0,,snopes,,Finnish President Sauli Niinistö posted a video after his White House visit saying that he'd rather hang around reindeer than Donald Trump.,2019-10-07,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/president-finland-wh-video/,,,,"On Oct. 2, 2019, a joint press conference at the White House with U.S. President Donald Trump and President Sauli Niinistö of Finland spiraled out of control as reporters began questioning President Trump about a recent whistleblower complaint and an ongoing impeachment investigation. Shortly after the fiery media event, a video began circulating on social media which supposedly showed the Finnish president relaying a few of his thoughts about his White House visit:Finnish President recounts Oval Office meeting.

A number of internet users posted jokes and memes about the perceived political awkwardness at the media event, and CBS News reported of the event that:reportedPresident Trump dominated the headlines with a heated press conference, during which he called Congressman Adam Schiff a “lowlife,” doubled down on his attacks against the whistleblower, and threatened to sue several people. Caught in the crossfire between Mr. Trump and the reporters at the White House was the visiting Finnish President Sauli Niinistö, who spent much of the event sidelined beside Mr. Trump.Niinistö, however, emerged from the crucible to win praise for the way he handled it. And because Americans can’t resist using social media to express their feelings, Niinistö also got the meme treatment.“Finnish President doing a Jim from The Office,” one person wrote, referring to the mockumentary character’s signature stare into the camera — often used to say, without words, “I can’t believe what I’m witnessing right now,” or “get me out of here.”Finnish President doing a Jim from The Office#TrumpMeltdown pic.twitter.com/Ko4o4mxVLN— DogsHateBoots (@DogsHateBoots) October 2, 2019President Trump dominated the headlines with a heated press conference, during which he called Congressman Adam Schiff a “lowlife,” doubled down on his attacks against the whistleblower, and threatened to sue several people.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., was going smoothly until a woman in a black jacket stood up and started rambling her fears about apocalyptic climate change. Then she took her jacket off, revealing a T-shirt that read, “Save the planet. Eat the children.”T-shirtThe woman said she was glad Ocasio-Cortez supported the Green New Deal but stated it was not enough. “Your new campaign slogan has to be this,” she stated, taking her jacket off and revealing the shirt. “We got to start eating babies. We don’t have enough time. … Even if you would bomb Russia, we still have too many people, too much pollution!”Words and images from the event shared online prompted reactions from many, including U.S. President Donald Trump and his eldest son, Donald Jr.includingSeems like a normal AOC supporter to me. https://t.co/NWVMRD0wsl— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 4, 2019Seems like a normal AOC supporter to me. https://t.co/NWVMRD0wslhttps://t.co/NWVMRD0wsl— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 4, 2019October 4, 2019During the town hall, Ocasio-Cortez responded to the woman by talking about the need for positive solutions to climate change and concluding, “We are never beyond hope” before quickly moving on to another question.Although some on the political right criticized her response, Ocasio-Cortez followed up on Twitter by explaining that she had been operating under the assumption that the woman was mentally ill and in crisis.somerightThis person may have been suffering from a mental condition and it’s not okay that the right-wing is mocking her and potentially make her condition or crisis worse.

Be a decent human being and knock it off.— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 4, 2019October 4, 2019It turned out the woman in question was neither an Ocasio-Cortez supporter nor a person having a mental-health emergency but apparently acting at the behest of a group called Lyndon LaRouche PAC. The stunt was meant to troll Ocasio-Cortez.groupHistorian Matthew Sweet described the group as a “bizarre political cult” in an interview with The Washington Post about the incident. Sweet, who has studied the group’s history, told the Post that the woman’s stunt fell in line with their standard operating procedures. “The tactic,” Sweet told the Post, “is you go to a political meeting and you create a disturbance that disrupts the meeting, and more importantly, that creates a kind of chaos.”describedThe group, dubbed LaRouchians, has been around for decades, and was founded by conspiracy crank Lyndon LaRouche, who died in February 2019 at the age of 96 after building a “worldwide following based on conspiracy theories, economic doom, anti-Semitism, homophobia and racism.”buildingLaRouche’s conspiracy theories involve proffering claims that the Queen of England controls the international drug trade and that Adolf Hitler, whose forces bombed England in World War II, was a British agent.controlsagent",[],"[{""id"" : 645042"",""""begin"": 33,""end"": 46,""entity"": ""New York City"",""text"": ""New York City"",""score"": 0.40,""categories"" : [""New York

2,,snopes,,"A photograph shows a bride and groom during a """"Handmaid's Tale""""-themed wedding.",2019-10-04,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/handmaid-tale-themed-wedding/,,,,"In October 2019, a photograph supposedly showing a bride and groom surrounded by a group of “Handmaid’s Tale”-dressed bridesmaids in front of a “Hanging Wall” went viral on social media, with many people expressing shock that someone would use the popular dystopian novel as a basis for a themed wedding:viralThe picture stirred considerable controversy as it circulated online and left many people with questions. Before we get to the story behind this picture, let’s get some basic facts out of the way:This photograph was taken at Cambridge Mill, a restaurant and wedding venue in Ontario, Canada, that is also used as part of the set for the Hulu television series “The Handmaid’s Tale.” This photograph was taken in front of the “Hanging Wall” from the television show.  The handmaids were digitally inserted into this image by wedding photographers. The actual wedding was not “Handmaid’s Tale”-themed. This photograph was taken at Cambridge Mill, a restaurant and wedding venue in Ontario, Canada, that is also used as part of the set for the Hulu television series “The Handmaid’s Tale.” This photograph was taken in front of the “Hanging Wall” from the television show.  The handmaids were digitally inserted into this image by wedding photographers. The actual wedding was not “Handmaid’s Tale”-themed. This photograph was originally posted to the social media pages of Van Daele & Russell Photography and shows a couple identified only as Kendra and Torsten. Many viewers expressed “outrage” over the theme of “The Handmaid’s Tale,” a novel penned by Margaret Atwood in 1985 and later made into the Hulu show. The novel and show focus on a dystopian future in which fertile women, called handmaids, are subjected to brutal treatment and forced into child-bearing slavery. The hanging wall is a particular gruesome aspect of the show because it is where those who resist the rules of this new society are hanged. Van Daele & Russell PhotographyPhotographer Shawn Van Daele said the bride and groom are big fans of the “The Handmaid’s Tale.” And, since their wedding was being held at the same venue that doubles as a set for the show, they wanted a photograph of them in front of the hanging wall. Van Daele told Peta Pixel that he digitally added the handmaids after the photo shoot:Peta Pixel“The couple as well as ourselves are HUGE fans of the TV show (and obviously, first, the book). Anyone who would put out an image like this without understanding what it implies has bigger problems than upset people on social media,” Shawn tells PetaPixel. “I knew when creating the image that it would possibly upset people, but that’s sort of the point…to wake people up.”“The groom wanted photos on the ‘hanging wall,’ which is where we were taking their wedding photos; I joked about adding in some handmaids (since it seemed the natural thing to do since we were there … I’m certain any ‘creative’ or photographer would have the exact same thoughts),” continues Shawn. “We didn’t expect the photo to go viral, but we are SOOO HAPPY IT HAS because hopefully it will wake people up to how they too contribute to the oppression and hatred that they’re rightfully worked up over.”“The couple as well as ourselves are HUGE fans of the TV show (and obviously, first, the book). Anyone who would put out an image like this without understanding what it implies has bigger problems than upset people on social media,” Shawn tells PetaPixel. “I knew when creating the image that it would possibly upset people, but that’s sort of the point…to wake people up.”“The groom wanted photos on the ‘hanging wall,’ which is where we were taking their wedding photos; I joked about adding in some handmaids (since it seemed the natural thing to do since we were there … I’m certain any ‘creative’ or photographer would have the exact same thoughts),” continues Shawn. “We didn’t expect the photo to go viral, but we are SOOO HAPPY IT HAS because hopefully it will wake people up to how they too contribute to the oppression and hatred that they’re rightfully worked up over.”In sum, though this image will likely be the one most viewed from this couple’s wedding, they didn’t actually have a themed wedding based on the dystopian novel. The bride and groom are fans of the show and because the wedding was being held at Cambridge Mill, where part of the show is filmed, they decided to take at least one handmaid’s-themed photograph.have a themed weddingPeta Pixel reported:reportedIn the end, Shawn wants to remind people that this wasn’t “a ‘Handmaid’s Tale’ themed wedding,” it was their wedding day. One photo in a series of thousands from their wedding day that was intended mostly as a keepsake for them.“Everyone loves a good witch hunt …” laments Shawn. “Apparently today we are their witch.”In the end, Shawn wants to remind people that this wasn’t “a ‘Handmaid’s Tale’ themed wedding,” it was their wedding day.

4,,snopes,,"In September 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law a bill that provides $1.8 billion in funding for autism research and services.",2019-10-04,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-autism-1-8-billion/,,,,"We received multiple inquiries from readers in October 2019 about the accuracy of news reports that claimed U.S. President Donald Trump had signed legislation that would provide $1.8 billion in funding for autism-related programs and research. For example, on Oct. 2, ABC News published an article with the headline, “Trump Signs $1.8 Billion Autism Funding Bill” which reported that:article“President Donald Trump signed the Autism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education and Support Act (CARES) into law Monday, which allocates $1.8 billion in funding over the next five years to help people with autism spectrum disorder and their families … The funding, which backs autism research and autism-related support programs, will also prioritize grants for rural and underserved areas.”Various Fox-owned regional news channels published an article with the headline, “President Trump Signs Bill Providing $1.8 Billion in Funding for Autism Programs,” which reported that:newschannels“President Trump has signed a bill that allocates $1.8 billion in funding to help people on the autism spectrum. The Autism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education and Support (CARES) Act was signed into law Monday. The bill provides funding for autism programs and research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and the Health Resources and Services Administration.“The bill, which reauthorizes the previous Autism CARES Act of 2014, expands government programs to include older people with autism ‘who were — and are– often misdiagnosed, underdiagnosed and overlooked,’ according to Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), one of the bill’s co-sponsors in the House of Representatives.”Those reports were accurate. On Sept. 30, Trump did indeed sign into law H.R. 1058, the Autism Collaboration, Accountability, Research, Education and Support Act of 2019, as the Congressional Record shows. The “Autism CARES Act” became law on that date. showsThe legislation, which was authored by U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., commits to spending $369.7 million every fiscal year between 2020 and 2024 — a total of $1.85 billion over five years. As such, the news articles were also highly accurate in reporting that the bill Trump signed allocates $1.8 billion. In fact, the total is slightly higher. commitsThat funding commitment represents a 42 percent increase on the $1.3 billion that Congress allocated for 2015-2019, in the 2014 Autism CARES Act. The bill had sponsors from both parties and received wide bipartisan support in both houses. It was passed without need for a roll-call vote in the House on July 24 and in the Senate on Sept. 19.HouseSenateThe bill essentially reauthorized the Autism CARES Act of 2014, which had been sponsored by Smith in the House, and Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., in the Senate. It provided funding for the disbursement of grants to researchers, as well as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) programs and centers across the country.2014Former President Barack Obama signed the bill into law on Aug. 8, 2014. The 2019 bill added new provisions whereby the Director of the National Institutes of Health could prioritize funding for research, programs and services in “rural or underserved areas,” and take into account the extent to which an applicant served “youth and adults from diverse racial, ethnic, geographic, or linguistic backgrounds.”provisionsIn the past, President Trump has repeatedly promoted the long-debunked theory that vaccinations cause autism, but his position may have shifted somewhat. Earlier in 2019, he urged parents to vaccinate their children against measles, in the midst of an outbreak of the disease. urged",[],"[{""id"" : 4848272"",""""begin"": 121,""end"": 133,""entity"":

While Clinton would eventually be impeached on charges such as “making false and misleading statements to potential grand jury witnesses,” this fake tweet is commenting on a bluntly (and incorrectly) boiled-down version of Clinton’s impeachment.impeachmentThis tweet does not appear on Lewinsky’s official Twitter timeline. We also searched a cached version of her page to see if the tweet had recently been deleted, but came up empty there, as well. timelineWhile we found a number of people sharing this message, they all did so by posting a text version of this message or by posting the above-displayed screenshot. We were unable to find any instances of a person retweeting the actual tweet link, nor any links to a genuine message that was recently deleted. actualThis tweet is also suspicious because the image indicates it was sent with “Twitter for Android.” Lewinksy’s tweets, however, are most often sent via iPhone. iPhoneThis fake tweet appears to have been created by the @electorotting (notice watermark in upper right-hand corner of image), an Instagram page that frequently posts political memes and jokes. While the account occasionally shares genuine posts from political leaders (Sen. Lindsey Graham truly once posted on Twitter “If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed … and we will deserve it”), the fake tweets shared by @electorotting all appear to be marked with the social media page’s watermark.  InstagramsharesSen.

6,,snopes,,NASA and NOAA faked climate data in the GISTEMP global temperature record to exaggerate global warming.,2019-10-03,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/global-warming-data-faked/,,,,"Since 2014, climate-change deniers have squeezed millions of views, Facebook shares, and Twitter retweets by retelling a story alleging the discovery of “faked” NASA data designed to “fit a climate change narrative.” Though copied almost wholesale from a blog post, the version of the story that has had the most online traction was published on the one-stop conspiracy theory/supplement shop that goes by the name Natural News. The article suggested:squeezedblog postsuggestedIn what might be the largest scientific fraud ever uncovered, NASA and the NOAA have been caught red-handed altering historical temperature data to produce a “climate change narrative” that defies reality. […] We now know that historical temperature data for the continental United States were deliberately altered by NASA and NOAA scientists in a politically-motivated attempt to rewrite history and claim global warming is causing U.S. temperatures to trend upward.In what might be the largest scientific fraud ever uncovered, NASA and the NOAA have been caught red-handed altering historical temperature data to produce a “climate change narrative” that defies reality. […] We now know that historical temperature data for the continental United States were deliberately altered by NASA and NOAA scientists in a politically-motivated attempt to rewrite history and claim global warming is causing U.S. temperatures to trend upward.There is a lot to unpack here, but the first thing you need to know is records of global surface temperatures are constantly refined based on the addition of new data, fresh statistical analyses, or new historical insight into the history of a specific source of data. Reporting on such a shift as something to “uncover” betrays a potentially willful ignorance of how climate science operates. These changes are publicly reported, based on stated scientific criteria, and subjected to rigorous internal and external peer review.constantly refinedWhere is this coming from?The “smoking gun” concerns a climate record known as the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP). These records are based on a massive global dataset of temperature stations from around the world, combining several collections of data originally collected by individual weather stations. The record provides “a measure of the changing global surface temperature with monthly resolution for the period since 1880, when a reasonably global distribution of meteorological stations was established.”GISTEMPprovidesTo argue for evidence of “faked” data, Natural News, as well as the original blog post, highlighted a version of the GISTEMP record for the United States first published in 1999, comparing it to one published later, in 2012. The record, these sources point out, has shifted:(These charts plot how far off each year’s average U.S. temperature differs from the average temperature for the entire period 1951–1980; the frame labeled “a” is from 1999.)chartsIt should be no shock that the data shifted following 1999, as illustrated graphically in the above diagram, because NASA published multiple papers in 1999 and 2001 about these changes and why they were made. Links to these papers can be found on the NASA website, which also publicly summarizes the changes in several other places.multiplepapers summarizesWhy adjust climate data?Writing for the climate information website Skeptical Science, Berkeley Earth research scientist Zeke Hausfather, whose work (in part) independently analyzes adjustments made by government agencies’ climate records, explained the need for making adjustments to such datasets in general. A primary misconception, he argues, is that an “unadjusted global temperature record” — which necessarily has to take into account not only the temperature reading at a given recording station, but also how to translate that data spatially to come up with a single annual or monthly number — is not really a thing that exists to begin with:Zeke HausfatherexplainedThere are a number of folks who question the need for adjustments at all. Why not just use raw temperatures, they ask, since those are pure and unadulterated? The problem is that … there is really no such thing as a pure and unadulterated temperature record. Temperature stations in the U.S. are mainly operated by volunteer observers (the Cooperative Observer Network, or co-op stations for short). Many of these stations were set up in the late 1800s and early 1900s as part of a national network of weather stations, focused on measuring day-to-day changes in the weather rather than decadal-scale changes in the climate.Nearly every single station in the network in the network has been moved at least once over the last century, with many having 3 or more distinct moves. Most of the stations have changed [the type of instruments used]. Observation times have shifted from afternoon to morning at most stations since 1960, as part of an effort by the National Weather Service to improve precipitation measurements.There are a number of folks who question the need for adjustments at all.

Observation times have shifted from afternoon to morning at most stations since 1960, as part of an effort by the National Weather Service to improve precipitation measurements.So what were the issues that led to changes between the 1999 record and the later record? According to NASA’s GISTEMP website, “Starting in the 1990s, the methodology took into account documented non-climatic biases in the raw data and eliminated or corrected unrealistic outliers.” The goal of these adjustments is to remove shoddy data from the dataset using pre-established methodologies, not to fit a “climate change narrative.”AccordingThese “non-climatic biases” include things like stations taking temperature measurements at different times of day, stations physically moving locations (sometimes to a different elevation), and other artifacts that produce change in a record not attributable to climate or weather. These non-climatic biases were identified and their method of adjustment described in a publicly available 2001 paper found, among other places, on NASA’s website. They included:includedTime of observation: Not all stations collect observations at the same time, and some stations — most significantly in the United States — have changed the time at which data is collected over time. Correcting for these effects is the most significant adjustment made to the GISTEMP dataset post-1999.Station location history: Sometimes stations move to another location, affecting the record. Post-1999 records take this into account.Change in thermometer type: A well-defined shift in data came from a change from liquid-in-glass thermometers to the maximum-minimum temperature system (MMTS). Post-1999 records take this into account.Urban heat effect: Densely populated urban areas retain heat more than rural areas. An increase in stations in urban areas over time, for example, would create a false warming trend. Post 1999 records take this into account as well.Time of observation: Not all stations collect observations at the same time, and some stations — most significantly in the United States — have changed the time at which data is collected over time.

The methods used and their effect on the data are all disclosed online. However the issues described above are largely moot at the time of this writing in 2019. The GISTEMP analyses at issue above concern a formulation of the dataset (GISTEMP v3) that has been replaced by an improved model named GISTEMP v4, which includes a much larger set of data and a whole other set of adjustments.employ modelsGISTEMP v4“Caught red-handed”All told, the most significant effect of all these changes came from the time-of-day adjustments. Collectively, the adjustments served to produce a slightly increased warming trend in the United States record compared to the earlier records.warming trendThe largest adjustments are the time of observation debiasing and station history adjustment, each of which increases the mean warming over the United States by about 0.15ºC over the 100 years. The net of all five adjustments to the … record is a warming of about 0.3ºCThe largest adjustments are the time of observation debiasing and station history adjustment, each of which increases the mean warming over the United States by about 0.15ºC over the 100 years. The net of all five adjustments to the … record is a warming of about 0.3ºCTo suggest — 14 years after the fact — that identifying publicly discussed adjustments to raw data whose methods have been published in peer-reviewed journals represents catching scientists “red-handed” in “the largest scientific fraud ever uncovered” exposes only the ignorance of the author, not some nefarious sleight of hand by climate scientists. As such, the claim is rated “False.”",[],"[{""id"" : 7529378"",""""begin"": 65,""end"": 73,""entity"": ""Facebook"",""text"": ""Facebook"",""score"": 0.37,""categories"" : [""Facebook"",""Android

7,,snopes,,"In September 2019, U.S. House Democrats voted for a bill that would create an electronic health record system for immigrants on the southern border which does not yet exist for military veterans.",2019-10-03,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dems-immigrants-vets-health/,,,,"In September and October 2019, we received multiple inquiries about the accuracy of news reports that claimed U.S. House Democrats had voted in favor of an electronic health records (EHR) system for undocumented immigrants at the southern border with Mexico, while also rejecting a similar system for U.S. military veterans. On Sept. 28, the right-leaning Western Journal website published an article with the headline “Dems Vote to Enhance Med Care for Illegals Now, Vote Down Vets Waiting 10 Years for Same Service.” The article reported that:Western Journal“House Democrats voted Thursday to fast-track an electronic medical records system that would serve illegal immigrants, something America’s veterans have been seeking for years … The Democratic proposal would require the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol to create an Electronic Health Record system … The bill gives the DHS 90 days after the bill receives final approval to get the job done. In contrast, the Veterans Administration has been working for years to implement an EHR system for veterans.”The article was given wider exposure when it was tweeted out by former Arkansas governor and Republican presidential primary candidate Mike Huckabee, who added: “Before Dems headed home to mingle with forgotten [people] who sent them to DC, they passed bill to fast-track an electronic medical records system for illegal immigrants but voted down a GOP plan to provide same for veterans, who have to wait 10 yrs for it.”Before Dems headed home to mingle with forgotten ppl who sent them to DC, they passed bill to fast-track an electronic medical records system for illegal immigrants but voted down a GOP plan to provide same for veterans, who have to wait 10 yrs for it.https://t.co/6C3xCxbNZj— Gov.

Mike Huckabee (@GovMikeHuckabee) September 30, 2019September 30, 2019In a similar vein, the website Chicks on the Right published an article with the headline, “Dems Vote to Give Illegal Aliens Better Healthcare System Than What’s at the VA or DoD.” That post claimed that:article“Democrats flexed the true might of their majority in the House on Thursday when they voted to give illegal immigrants living in the United States an electronic medical records system that is better than the one currently being used at the Veterans Affairs Administration or the Department of Defense.”In support of the claim that House Democrats had rejected the opportunity to propose the same EHR system for veterans as it was proposing for immigrants, Western Journal cited comments made by Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn. In a tweet, Burchett wrote, “Amendment to give veterans same healthcare as illegals fails. Are you kidding me?”In an accompanying video, Burchett said the bill had related to “providing healthcare benefits to illegal aliens,” adding “When the Republicans attempted to put an amendment on there that made it so that our veterans would receive the same benefits, oddly enough they voted against that amendment …”Amendment to give VETERANS same healthcare as ILLEGALS fails.

Mark Walker, R-N.C., writing:The claims made by Western Journal, Huckabee, Burchett, Chicks on the Right, and Walker were largely inaccurate and grossly misleading.AnalysisAn EHR system already exists for veteransAn EHR system already exists for veteransIn reality, an electronic health record system (EHR) already exists for veterans in the U.S., and has done so for years. What House Republicans alluded to were improvements to that system, scheduled to be implemented over the next decade, whose delays in implementation have proven controversial.already existsimprovementsscheduledcontroversialThe enhanced, modernized, updated EHR system for veterans and serving military members is not the same as the comparatively rather basic EHR system being proposed, for the first time, for immigrants stopped at the U.S. border.  is not the sameWhat the immigrant bill actually proposedWhat the immigrant bill actually proposedA bill passed by the House on Sept. 26 (H.R. 3525) proposed introducing an EHR system related to immigrants stopped crossing into the United States, but it did not propose giving them any specific “healthcare benefits,” as Burchett falsely claimed. It certainly did not propose a “better healthcare system” or better EHR system for immigrants stopped at the border than currently exists in relation to serving military personnel or military veterans, as Chicks on the Right falsely claimed. H.R. 3525The full text of the legislation, introduced by Rep. Lauren Underwood, D-Ill., can be read here. Roughly speaking, it proposes two innovations: here“Comprehensive medical screening of individuals, particularly children, pregnant women, the elderly, and other vulnerable populations, interdicted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection between ports of entry”“An electronic health record system that can be accessed by all departmental components operating along the borders of the United States for individuals in the custody of such components.”“Comprehensive medical screening of individuals, particularly children, pregnant women, the elderly, and other vulnerable populations, interdicted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection between ports of entry”“An electronic health record system that can be accessed by all departmental components operating along the borders of the United States for individuals in the custody of such components.”What House Republicans proposed (and Democrats rejected)What House Republicans proposed (and Democrats rejected)The Republican proposal that Democrats rejected during the course of the debate would not have provided veterans what was proposed, in Underwood’s bill, for immigrants crossing the border. That claim, as made by Burchett and Huckabee, was false for two reasons.First, an EHR system already exists for veterans, so veterans therefore already have what the bill proposed for immigrants. Second, the Republican proposal did not actually propose any services, whether new services or an expansion of existing services, for veterans. Rather, it proposed delaying the implementation of the immigrant EHR system until 2027, the date on which the roll out of the new, improved veterans EHR system is expected to be completed. Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., introduced the “motion to recommit” (to send the bill back to the Homeland Security committee for reconsideration), which included the 2027 delay proposal. From the floor of the House, Green said:Despite improvements in the VA electronic health record system, problems and delays still remain … The very benefits that Congresswoman Underwood, in this bill, advances for illegal aliens flooding across our southern border — our veterans don’t have those benefits. Let me say that again. This bill, without the amendment I’m asking this body to consider, advances healthcare services to illegal aliens, before it does our American heroes.The VA secretary testified before Congress that it will take his department 10 years to fully deploy this new system … This timelines states that our veterans will not get an interoperable electronic health record [system] at all VA facilities until September 20, 2027 … All this amendment does is ensure our veterans get this service first. If you vote against this motion to recommit, you are giving an electronic medical health record [system] to illegal aliens, before our veterans. Despite improvements in the VA electronic health record system, problems and delays still remain … The very benefits that Congresswoman Underwood, in this bill, advances for illegal aliens flooding across our southern border — our veterans don’t have those benefits. Let me say that again. This bill, without the amendment I’m asking this body to consider, advances healthcare services to illegal aliens, before it does our American heroes.The VA secretary testified before Congress that it will take his department 10 years to fully deploy this new system … This timelines states that our veterans will not get an interoperable electronic health record [system] at all VA facilities until September 20, 2027 … All this amendment does is ensure our veterans get this service first. If you vote against this motion to recommit, you are giving an electronic medical health record [system] to illegal aliens, before our veterans.   That claim was false. As we have explained already, the VA has had an EHR system for years, as Green himself acknowledged just moments earlier, when he said “despite improvements in the VA electronic health record system, problems and delays still remain.”If Green and others were to propose that, as a matter of principle, Congress ought to implement the new and improved VA EHR system before it creates any EHR system for immigrants detained along the southern border, that would be a subjective value judgment to which nobody could pose any factual objection.new and improvedanyHowever, the specific and explicit factual claim made by Green and others was that Underwood’s bill would provide, in the context of immigrants detained at the border, an EHR system that does not yet exist for veterans, and will not fully exist until 2027. That claim was false. The only accurate element in the foregoing news articles and pronouncements was the claim that House Democrats had introduced a bill that would create an EHR system relating to immigrants detained along the southern border. As such, we issue a rating of “Mostly False.”",[],"[{""id"" : 58236"",""""begin"": 761,""end"": 792,""entity"": ""United States Department of Homeland Security"",""text"": ""Department of Homeland

8,,snopes,,"U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff is """"linked"""" to a Ukrainian arms dealer.",2019-10-03,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/adam-schiff-ukrainian/,,,,"A smear piece targeting U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff swept a California businessman and engineer into the mix and, in doing so, potentially endangered his child. On Sept. 29, 2019, the right-leaning website The Gateway Pundit posted a story headlined, “EXPLOSIVE REPORT: Rep. Adam Schiff Linked to Prominent Ukrainian Arms Dealer!” The purported “arms dealer” in the story is Igor Pasternak, who is neither a prominent arms dealer nor a Ukrainian.right-leaningIgor PasternakSoon after the Gateway Pundit story was published, Fox News primetime host Laura Ingraham boosted the same narrative on her own widely watched program. Both outlets were lashing out in defense of U.S. President Donald Trump, who is facing an impeachment inquiry spearheaded by Schiff, a Democrat from California who chairs the House Intelligence Committee.boostedTrump is accused of using his office to obtain damaging information on a political rival from the Ukrainian government. Thus both The Gateway Pundit and Ingraham attempted to make the case that Schiff had equally inappropriate dealings with Ukraine. But the story is thin, based entirely on the fact that Pasternak, an engineer and business owner, hosted a fundraiser for Schiff in 2013.Fox News falsely reported that Pasternak “moved his corporation into [Schiff’s] California district” and stated without proof that Schiff “could have” traded political favors for campaign donations. Pasternak’s company, Worldwide Aeros Corp, is based in Montebello, California, and is not in Schiff’s Congressional district (Pasternak’s district is the 38th, represented by Linda Sanchez). Pasternak, who spoke to us by phone, said neither Fox nor The Gateway Pundit reached out to him for his side of the story.The Gateway Pundit story claims Pasternak “sold arms in places like Syria” and “has also been connected to [billionaire philanthropist] George Soros.” This is a laughable fantasy, Pasternak said.“It’s not like stretching of the truth or a misrepresent the facts,” Pasternak told us. “It just has nothing to do with reality.”It’s also not a new narrative. The same story floated in 2018 on a different website, that time in response to a memo authored by Schiff detailing Russian meddling in the 2016 election. different websitePasternak did host a fundraiser for Schiff in 2013, but he told us he has donated to multiple politicians, both Democratic and Republican, a statement that can be confirmed by searching his name on the government transparency tool Open Secrets. And he did design some military hardware, including small arms and surveillance equipment, which were used by the Ukrainian military in that country’s conflict with Russian forces.Open SecretsBut his company’s main occupation is the manufacture of airships, also known as lighter-than-air aircraft. Furthermore, Pasternak was raised in Ukraine but was born in Kazakhstan. He is also an American citizen. His mother tongue is Russian, he told us. He doesn’t speak Ukrainian.Pasternak took The Gateway Pundit’s smear against him in stride, joking that the website had publicized “the best picture of me.”But what attracted his concern was that the story included a collage of images, some of which Pasternak believes were taken from his Facebook account. In that collage were not only pictures of his young son but the boy’s name. The story also contained the family’s home address. The information has been posted by various troll accounts on social media, prompting Pasternak to contact authorities.“It really to me is not a joke,” Pasternak told us. “If it was just me, then OK, thank you for publicizing my best picture.” But Pasternak, who like Soros is Jewish, read it in a threatening light, noting the collage contained more images of his child than of him. “They clearly understand he’s the most vulnerable point for me.”Soros, whose foundation donates money to progressive causes, is the frequent target of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.targetPasternak said he didn’t make any money off the equipment sent to the Ukrainian military and elected to do so after becoming emotionally moved while visiting Maidan square shortly after deadly clashes with protesters and police in 2014. Pasternak said it’s possible he has been the target of disinformation because his pro-Ukraine activities in the face of Ukraine’s conflict with Russia got him on “Putin’s bad list.”Since at least 2014, the Russians have harnessed social media in the U.S. to spread disinformation to influence public opinion, a technique they deployed in their 2016 U.S. election-interference operation.harnessedWe reached out to Gateway Pundit founder Jim Hoft, asking why the story on his website included the identity and photograph of an uninvolved child, but received no response. Although we normally link to stories we fact check, we chose not to do so in this case because the Pundit story identifies a child and contains his picture and address.",[],"[{""id"" :

The same networks that wailed for hours about the inhumanity of illegal migrant “kids in cages” had no interest in something a thousandfold more horrific.In a tweet promoting the article, Life News also claimed that these outlets “haven’t run a single word about the abortionist” and then added: “Shame on you for censoring the truth about the brutality of abortion.”tweetThese outlets are not “censoring” this story, nor did they “refuse” to cover it. In reality, ABC, NBC, NPR, CBS Chicago, and WTTW (Chicago’s PBS station) have all published stories about this disturbing discovery:NBC News on September 13: “Thousands of fetal remains found at Illinois property that belonged to abortion doctor.”ABC News on September 20: “Patient records found at shuttered Indiana abortion clinics.”NPR on September 19: “Fate Of Fetal Remains Unclear As Investigation Continues In Indiana.”WTTW (Chicago PBS) on September 19: “Indiana, Illinois AGs Investigate After Fetal Remains Found.”CBS Chicago on September 14: “‘No One Has Any Answers’: Attorney Speaks For Family Of Abortion Doctor Who Left Thousands Of Fetal Remains On His Property After He Died.”NBC News on September 13: “Thousands of fetal remains found at Illinois property that belonged to abortion doctor.”NBC News on September 13: “Thousands of fetal remains found at Illinois property that belonged to abortion doctor.”ABC News on September 20: “Patient records found at shuttered Indiana abortion clinics.”ABC News on September 20: “Patient records found at shuttered Indiana abortion clinics.”NPR on September 19: “Fate Of Fetal Remains Unclear As Investigation Continues In Indiana.”NPR on September 19: “Fate Of Fetal Remains Unclear As Investigation Continues In Indiana.”WTTW (Chicago PBS) on September 19: “Indiana, Illinois AGs Investigate After Fetal Remains Found.”WTTW (Chicago PBS) on September 19: “Indiana, Illinois AGs Investigate After Fetal Remains Found.”CBS Chicago on September 14: “‘No One Has Any Answers’: Attorney Speaks For Family Of Abortion Doctor Who Left Thousands Of Fetal Remains On His Property After He Died.”CBS Chicago on September 14: “‘No One Has Any Answers’: Attorney Speaks For Family Of Abortion Doctor Who Left Thousands Of Fetal Remains On His Property After He Died.”We found no mention of this story, however, on MSNBC.com or CBSnews.com.MSNBC.comCBSnews.comThe Life News article, which was originally published on Newsbusters under the less sensational title “Bozell & Graham Column: Abortion Horrors Buried by the Press,” is attempting to comment on the fact that the story of Klopfer received little attention on national television news broadcasts. And that is true. We searched for mentions of Klopfer on TV Eyes and, as of Oct. 3, 2019, found the vast majority of coverage on this case came from local news outlets. NewsbustersHowever, Life News’ coverage of this critique is severely misleading. The website claimed that these outlets were “refusing” to cover this story, attempting to “censor” the truth, and that they had failed to “run a single word about the abortionist.”  But, as one can see above, that isn’t the case. Many of the aforementioned outlets did provide coverage of this story, even if it was only on their websites. If ABC, NBC, or NPR were truly trying to “censor” the truth about this abortionist, they probably wouldn’t publish news stories about it on their sites.It should also be noted that Life News’ claim that these outlets “refused” to cover this story is based on little more than an absence of broadcast coverage. Life News provides no evidence (and makes no attempt to do so) to show that anyone in charge of the networks actively forbade reporters from covering the story. Simply not covering a story, of course, is not the same as refusing to cover a story. refusingNews outlets, especially newspapers with limited space and television news outlets with limited airtime, continuously make decisions about which stories to cover in order to best serve their audiences. PBS News points to five criteria that journalists consider when determining if a story is newsworthy: Timeliness, proximity, conflict and controversy, human interest, and relevance.PBS NewsAs this discovery was made in Illinois and involved a doctor who performed abortions in Indiana, this story has received a lot of local news coverage from outlets in these states. National news outlets, however, have to serve a national audience and decide what to cover from a wider pool of reporting. The fact that this story did not make it to prime time national television doesn’t necessarily mean these outlets “refused” to cover it, just that other stories were deemed more worthy of airtime. While Life News may have a point when it argues this story deserved more national coverage, claiming these outlets “refused” to cover the story, wanted to “censor” the truth, and failed to

11,,snopes,,"In 2019, city officials in Portland, Oregon, announced or implemented a prohibition on urinals in public buildings in the city.",2019-10-02,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/portland-ban-urinals-buildings/,,,,"We received multiple inquiries from readers in September 2019 about the accuracy of reports that claimed officials in Portland, Oregon, had decided to “ban urinals” from public buildings in the city. On Sept. 25, the right-leaning website The Gateway Pundit posted an article with the headline “Portland Bans Urinals in Public Buildings — Out of Respect to the City’s ‘Shared Values,'” which reported that:article“The city of Portland (where else) is now banning urinals in city-owned buildings and spending taxpayer money to remove them. The first urinal-free building is appropriately called The Portland Building, where countless paper-shuffling city bureaucrats congregate to waste oxygen and demand pay raises.”That post cited an earlier article by local television channel KGW8, which reported that:KGW8The City of Portland banned urinals in the remodeled Portland Building. Urinals, for those who have never been in a men’s bathroom, are porcelain receptors without seats or lids that allow men to quickly relieve themselves … In an email to employees last February, Chief Administrative Officer Tom Rinehart wrote:“We will continue to have gender-specific (male and female) multi-stall restrooms that are readily available to any employee that prefers to use one. But, there will be no urinals in any restroom in the building. This will give us the flexibility we need for any future changes in signage.”The city has redesigned all the bathrooms to be gender neutral — which means urinals are banned [even] in the men’s room.The City of Portland banned urinals in the remodeled Portland Building. Urinals, for those who have never been in a men’s bathroom, are porcelain receptors without seats or lids that allow men to quickly relieve themselves … In an email to employees last February, Chief Administrative Officer Tom Rinehart wrote:“We will continue to have gender-specific (male and female) multi-stall restrooms that are readily available to any employee that prefers to use one. But, there will be no urinals in any restroom in the building. This will give us the flexibility we need for any future changes in signage.”The city has redesigned all the bathrooms to be gender neutral — which means urinals are banned [even] in the men’s room.KGW8 also claimed, in its headline, that urinals had been “banned” from the Portland Building, though, unlike The Gateway Pundit, it did not claim the purported ban extended to all public buildings in the city. AnalysisPortland city officials have indeed decided not to install urinals in any bathrooms in the Portland Building, which was under renovation as of September 2019. However, The Gateway Pundit’s article was misleading and illogical in characterizing that decision as a “ban” and also inaccurate in claiming that the urinal policy applied to all public buildings (or even more than one) in the city. A spokesperson for the city’s Office of Management and Finance and the Portland Building reconstruction project confirmed to Snopes in an email that officials “chose not to install urinals when the restrooms were remodeled,” and provided a graphic that showed the expected layout of bathrooms in the building, including female, male and “all-user” (gender-neutral) bathrooms.graphicThe absence of urinals in either male or all-user bathrooms, the spokesperson explained, meant that “in the future, we have the ability to move to all-user restrooms on additional floors.”In his email to employees in February 2019, Portland’s Chief Administrative officer Tom Rinehart explained that all of the bathrooms had also been designed to be identical to one another, meaning that if officials later chose to convert some gender-specific bathrooms to gender-neutral status, that switch could more easily be made. emailThat email, and the plan in question, related only to the Portland Building, meaning The Gateway Pundit’s headline claim — that the city had “banned urinals from public buildings” — was false. Rather, the spokesperson told us:“It is possible that, in future remodels of other city buildings, urinals may not be installed if restrooms are renovated. There are no plans to remove urinals as a separate project.”The description of the Portland Building urinal policy as a “ban” on urinals — as claimed by both The Gateway Pundit and KGW8 — was illogical and grossly misleading. The city itself owns and manages the building and is responsible for overseeing its renovation.Rather, the city has made a design choice in order to facilitate potential future changes to the gender status of bathrooms in the building. For the foregoing reasons, we issue a rating of “Mostly False.”",[],"[{""id"" : 23503"",""""begin"": 118,""end"": 133,""entity"": ""Portland, Oregon"",""text"":

While Clinton would eventually be impeached on charges such as “making false and misleading statements to potential grand jury witnesses,” this fake tweet is commenting on a bluntly (and incorrectly) boiled-down version of Clinton’s impeachment.impeachmentThis tweet does not appear on Lewinsky’s official Twitter timeline. We also searched a cached version of her page to see if the tweet had recently been deleted, but came up empty there, as well. timelineWhile we found a number of people sharing this message, they all did so by posting a text version of this message or by posting the above-displayed screenshot. We were unable to find any instances of a person retweeting the actual tweet link, nor any links to a genuine message that was recently deleted. actualThis tweet is also suspicious because the image indicates it was sent with “Twitter for Android.” Lewinksy’s tweets, however, are most often sent via iPhone. iPhoneThis fake tweet appears to have been created by the @electorotting (notice watermark in upper right-hand corner of image), an Instagram page that frequently posts political memes and jokes. While the account occasionally shares genuine posts from political leaders (Sen. Lindsey Graham truly once posted on Twitter “If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed … and we will deserve it”), the fake tweets shared by @electorotting all appear to be marked with the social media page’s watermark.  InstagramsharesSen.

13,,snopes,,NASA and NOAA faked climate data in the GISTEMP global temperature record to exaggerate global warming.,2019-10-03,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/global-warming-data-faked/,,,,"Since 2014, climate-change deniers have squeezed millions of views, Facebook shares, and Twitter retweets by retelling a story alleging the discovery of “faked” NASA data designed to “fit a climate change narrative.” Though copied almost wholesale from a blog post, the version of the story that has had the most online traction was published on the one-stop conspiracy theory/supplement shop that goes by the name Natural News. The article suggested:squeezedblog postsuggestedIn what might be the largest scientific fraud ever uncovered, NASA and the NOAA have been caught red-handed altering historical temperature data to produce a “climate change narrative” that defies reality. […] We now know that historical temperature data for the continental United States were deliberately altered by NASA and NOAA scientists in a politically-motivated attempt to rewrite history and claim global warming is causing U.S. temperatures to trend upward.In what might be the largest scientific fraud ever uncovered, NASA and the NOAA have been caught red-handed altering historical temperature data to produce a “climate change narrative” that defies reality. […] We now know that historical temperature data for the continental United States were deliberately altered by NASA and NOAA scientists in a politically-motivated attempt to rewrite history and claim global warming is causing U.S. temperatures to trend upward.There is a lot to unpack here, but the first thing you need to know is records of global surface temperatures are constantly refined based on the addition of new data, fresh statistical analyses, or new historical insight into the history of a specific source of data. Reporting on such a shift as something to “uncover” betrays a potentially willful ignorance of how climate science operates. These changes are publicly reported, based on stated scientific criteria, and subjected to rigorous internal and external peer review.constantly refinedWhere is this coming from?The “smoking gun” concerns a climate record known as the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP). These records are based on a massive global dataset of temperature stations from around the world, combining several collections of data originally collected by individual weather stations. The record provides “a measure of the changing global surface temperature with monthly resolution for the period since 1880, when a reasonably global distribution of meteorological stations was established.”GISTEMPprovidesTo argue for evidence of “faked” data, Natural News, as well as the original blog post, highlighted a version of the GISTEMP record for the United States first published in 1999, comparing it to one published later, in 2012. The record, these sources point out, has shifted:(These charts plot how far off each year’s average U.S. temperature differs from the average temperature for the entire period 1951–1980; the frame labeled “a” is from 1999.)chartsIt should be no shock that the data shifted following 1999, as illustrated graphically in the above diagram, because NASA published multiple papers in 1999 and 2001 about these changes and why they were made. Links to these papers can be found on the NASA website, which also publicly summarizes the changes in several other places.multiplepapers summarizesWhy adjust climate data?Writing for the climate information website Skeptical Science, Berkeley Earth research scientist Zeke Hausfather, whose work (in part) independently analyzes adjustments made by government agencies’ climate records, explained the need for making adjustments to such datasets in general. A primary misconception, he argues, is that an “unadjusted global temperature record” — which necessarily has to take into account not only the temperature reading at a given recording station, but also how to translate that data spatially to come up with a single annual or monthly number — is not really a thing that exists to begin with:Zeke HausfatherexplainedThere are a number of folks who question the need for adjustments at all. Why not just use raw temperatures, they ask, since those are pure and unadulterated? The problem is that … there is really no such thing as a pure and unadulterated temperature record. Temperature stations in the U.S. are mainly operated by volunteer observers (the Cooperative Observer Network, or co-op stations for short). Many of these stations were set up in the late 1800s and early 1900s as part of a national network of weather stations, focused on measuring day-to-day changes in the weather rather than decadal-scale changes in the climate.Nearly every single station in the network in the network has been moved at least once over the last century, with many having 3 or more distinct moves. Most of the stations have changed [the type of instruments used]. Observation times have shifted from afternoon to morning at most stations since 1960, as part of an effort by the National Weather Service to improve precipitation measurements.There are a number of folks who question the need for adjustments at all.

Observation times have shifted from afternoon to morning at most stations since 1960, as part of an effort by the National Weather Service to improve precipitation measurements.So what were the issues that led to changes between the 1999 record and the later record? According to NASA’s GISTEMP website, “Starting in the 1990s, the methodology took into account documented non-climatic biases in the raw data and eliminated or corrected unrealistic outliers.” The goal of these adjustments is to remove shoddy data from the dataset using pre-established methodologies, not to fit a “climate change narrative.”AccordingThese “non-climatic biases” include things like stations taking temperature measurements at different times of day, stations physically moving locations (sometimes to a different elevation), and other artifacts that produce change in a record not attributable to climate or weather. These non-climatic biases were identified and their method of adjustment described in a publicly available 2001 paper found, among other places, on NASA’s website. They included:includedTime of observation: Not all stations collect observations at the same time, and some stations — most significantly in the United States — have changed the time at which data is collected over time. Correcting for these effects is the most significant adjustment made to the GISTEMP dataset post-1999.Station location history: Sometimes stations move to another location, affecting the record. Post-1999 records take this into account.Change in thermometer type: A well-defined shift in data came from a change from liquid-in-glass thermometers to the maximum-minimum temperature system (MMTS). Post-1999 records take this into account.Urban heat effect: Densely populated urban areas retain heat more than rural areas. An increase in stations in urban areas over time, for example, would create a false warming trend. Post 1999 records take this into account as well.Time of observation: Not all stations collect observations at the same time, and some stations — most significantly in the United States — have changed the time at which data is collected over time.

The methods used and their effect on the data are all disclosed online. However the issues described above are largely moot at the time of this writing in 2019. The GISTEMP analyses at issue above concern a formulation of the dataset (GISTEMP v3) that has been replaced by an improved model named GISTEMP v4, which includes a much larger set of data and a whole other set of adjustments.employ modelsGISTEMP v4“Caught red-handed”All told, the most significant effect of all these changes came from the time-of-day adjustments. Collectively, the adjustments served to produce a slightly increased warming trend in the United States record compared to the earlier records.warming trendThe largest adjustments are the time of observation debiasing and station history adjustment, each of which increases the mean warming over the United States by about 0.15ºC over the 100 years.

The net of all five adjustments to the … record is a warming of about 0.3ºCTo suggest — 14 years after the fact — that identifying publicly discussed adjustments to raw data whose methods have been published in peer-reviewed journals represents catching scientists “red-handed” in “the largest scientific fraud ever uncovered” exposes only the ignorance of the author, not some nefarious sleight of hand by climate scientists. As such, the claim is rated “False.”",[],"[{""id"" : 7529378"",""""begin"": 65,""end"": 73,""entity"": ""Facebook"",""text"": ""Facebook"",""score"": 0.37,""categories"" : [""Facebook"",""Android

14,,snopes,,A supporter of U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggested eating babies to combat climate change at a town hall event.,2019-10-04,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/babies-climate-change-aoc/,,,,"An Oct. 3, 2019, town hall event in New York City hosted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., was going smoothly until a woman in a black jacket stood up and started rambling her fears about apocalyptic climate change. Then she took her jacket off, revealing a T-shirt that read, “Save the planet. Eat the children.”T-shirtThe woman said she was glad Ocasio-Cortez supported the Green New Deal but stated it was not enough. “Your new campaign slogan has to be this,” she stated, taking her jacket off and revealing the shirt. “We got to start eating babies. We don’t have enough time. … Even if you would bomb Russia, we still have too many people, too much pollution!”Words and images from the event shared online prompted reactions from many, including U.S. President Donald Trump and his eldest son, Donald Jr.includingSeems like a normal AOC supporter to me. https://t.co/NWVMRD0wsl— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 4, 2019Seems like a normal AOC supporter to me. https://t.co/NWVMRD0wslhttps://t.co/NWVMRD0wsl— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 4, 2019October 4, 2019During the town hall, Ocasio-Cortez responded to the woman by talking about the need for positive solutions to climate change and concluding, “We are never beyond hope” before quickly moving on to another question.Although some on the political right criticized her response, Ocasio-Cortez followed up on Twitter by explaining that she had been operating under the assumption that the woman was mentally ill and in crisis.somerightThis person may have been suffering from a mental condition and it’s not okay that the right-wing is mocking her and potentially make her condition or crisis worse. Be a decent human being and knock it off.— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 4, 2019This person may have been suffering from a mental condition and it’s not okay that the right-wing is mocking her and potentially make her condition or crisis worse. Be a decent human being and knock it off.— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 4, 2019October 4, 2019It turned out the woman in question was neither an Ocasio-Cortez supporter nor a person having a mental-health emergency but apparently acting at the behest of a group called Lyndon LaRouche PAC. The stunt was meant to troll Ocasio-Cortez.groupHistorian Matthew Sweet described the group as a “bizarre political cult” in an interview with The Washington Post about the incident. Sweet, who has studied the group’s history, told the Post that the woman’s stunt fell in line with their standard operating procedures. “The tactic,” Sweet told the Post, “is you go to a political meeting and you create a disturbance that disrupts the meeting, and more importantly, that creates a kind of chaos.”describedThe group, dubbed LaRouchians, has been around for decades, and was founded by conspiracy crank Lyndon LaRouche, who died in February 2019 at the age of 96 after building a “worldwide following based on conspiracy theories, economic doom, anti-Semitism, homophobia and racism.”buildingLaRouche’s conspiracy theories involve proffering claims that the Queen of England controls the international drug trade and that Adolf Hitler, whose forces bombed England in World War II, was a British agent.controlsagent",[],"[{""id"" : 645042"",""""begin"": 33,""end"": 46,""entity"": ""New York City"",""text"": ""New York City"",""score"": 0.40,""categories"" : [""New York

15,,snopes,,Videos have captured strange apocalyptic sounds coming from the sky all around the world.,2015-04-30,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-sound-of-apocalypse/,,,,"On 10 April 2015, the web site Latin Post shared a video purportedly featuring “strange apocalyptic sounds coming from the sky all around the world.” That video comprises clips from various videos uploaded to YouTube between 2011 and 2013; and while it’s impossible for us to offer a comprehensive explanation covering every clip seen in that video, we can provide a skeptical look about the alleged “apocalyptic noises” it references.Latin PostLatin PostThis video claims that there has been creepy strange noises around the world, many of the comments under these videos are very “world coming to an end” type comments. People are claiming they are trumpets playing. There is no scientific explanation for these noises. I just want to know it it’s nonsense or not.This video claims that there has been creepy strange noises around the world, many of the comments under these videos are very “world coming to an end” type comments. People are claiming they are trumpets playing. There is no scientific explanation for these noises. I just want to know it it’s nonsense or not.Unusual and unexplained noises are recorded in various locations around the world from time to time. While the specific origins of all such sounds may not yet be known, most scientific research points to natural causes such as tidal waves, methane explosions, underground earthquakes, or shifting sand dunes as explanations for these aural phenomena:researchThere are many potential explanations, according to David Hill, a scientist at the US Geological Survey, who wrote a recent scientific review paper rounding up the causes of mystery booms. In coastal regions, for instance, large bangs may accompany humungous waves hitting the cliffs; reports of thunderous sounds are apparently common among big-wave surfers in the US.Hill suspects that earthquakes are to blame in the majority of cases. He’s talking from experience; while in California’s Mammoth Mountain he was surrounded by a muffled booming sound, despite feeling no shaking. On inspecting his instruments he found evidence of small earthquakes less than 4 km (2.9 miles) below the surface. Whereas sounds of deeper earthquakes may be too low for human hearing, he has calculated that judders near the surface could transmit audible noises of the cracking crust.There are many potential explanations, according to David Hill, a scientist at the US Geological Survey, who wrote a recent scientific review paper rounding up the causes of mystery booms.

Whereas sounds of deeper earthquakes may be too low for human hearing, he has calculated that judders near the surface could transmit audible noises of the cracking crust.Although it is likely that “strange apocalyptic” booming sounds seemingly issuing from the sky have an earthly origin, USGS scientist David Hill said that it’s also possible some of these noises originate from above:You might think it unlikely that we would miss the flash of a meteor, but it’s not impossible, as Hill notes: ‘Because of the time required for a sonic shock wave to reach the Earth’s surface from the upper atmosphere, the visible trace of the meteor has usually vanished before its sonic boom is heard.’You might think it unlikely that we would miss the flash of a meteor, but it’s not impossible, as Hill notes: ‘Because of the time required for a sonic shock wave to reach the Earth’s surface from the upper atmosphere, the visible trace of the meteor has usually vanished before its sonic boom is heard.’Is that what we’re hearing in the video above — a distant earthquake or a passing meteor? Although some of the sounds captured in the video may have natural explanations, some of the other noises clearly originated from a common, artificial source: an iPhone.At the 4:45 mark in the above-displayed video, a clip purportedly taken in Alberta, Canada, begins to play and (like all of the other clips in this video) features a strange and seemingly unexplainable noise. But this section of the video is unique in having a definitive explanation: YouTube user DangleSnipeCelly08 admitted that the clip she uploaded on 14 January 2012 was a hoax:admittedI made the video by taking out my iPhone and merely video recorded my balcony view while holding my laptop right behind it, while my laptop played (another video featuring strange sounds) in the background. Took less than a minute to do this.I made it because I was surprised at the attention (these videos were) getting, and the friends on my Facebook friends list were voicing their fear, which I think is wrong. I easily found that the Conklin video and I believe the Ukraine video has the exact same audio on them (hello Tropical birds in Conklin), so I decided that I had to share my knowledge. I made the video to show my friends and family how easy it was (literally less than five minutes of my life to make the video and upload it) to make something like that, and how they shouldn’t believe everything they see online, and should especially not get fearful.I made the video by taking out my iPhone and merely video recorded my balcony view while holding my laptop right behind it, while my laptop played (another video featuring strange sounds) in the background.

Although it’s possible that a recurring natural phenomenon has been captured in various locations around the world, it is more plausible that a single audio stream was duplicated and embedded into multiple video clips.Latin PostStill, the original noise had to come from somewhere. So is this noise natural, or supernatural? The most likely answer is that the sound came from Hollywood:Even if the majority of clips in the video shared by Latin Post do not feature “apocalyptic noises” coming from the sky, the world is not void of unexplainable noises. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) still don’t know where the whistle over the Pacific Ocean originates, researchers are still unsure of what causes a mysterious “humming” noise heard by many people in Britain, and the USGS still hasn’t identified a cause for “skyquakes” booms.Latin Postwhistlehummingskyquakes",[],"[{""id"" : 3524766"",""""begin"": 205,""end"": 212,""entity"": ""YouTube"",""text"": ""YouTube"",""score"": 0.42,""categories"" : [""YouTube"",""2005 establishments in the United States"",""Article Feedback 5 Additional Articles"",""Companies based in San Mateo County, California"",""Companies established in 2005"",""Entertainment websites"",""Google acquisitions"",""Google services"",""Internet companies of the United States"",""Internet properties established in 2005"",""Multilingual websites"",""Video hosting"",""Video on demand services""]},{""id"" : 2681261"",""""begin"": 728,""end"": 733,""entity"": ""Laconic phrase"",""text"": ""it it"",""score"": 0.51,""categories"" : [""Rhetoric""]},{""id"" : 2681261"",""""begin"": 1033,""end"": 1038,""entity"": ""Laconic phrase"",""text"": ""it it"",""score"": 0.51,""categories"" : [""Rhetoric""]},{""id"" : 18582230"",""""begin"": 1294,""end"": 1301,""entity"": ""Methane"",""text"": ""methane"",""score"": 0.46,""categories"" : [""Methane"",""Anaerobic digestion"",""Greenhouse gases"",""Fuels"",""Fuel gas""]},{""id"" : 7674400"",""""begin"": 1461,""end"": 1471,""entity"": ""David Hill (Oregon politician)"",""text"": ""David Hill"",""score"": 0.36,""categories"" : [""People from Hillsboro, Oregon"",""Champoeg Meetings"",""Members of the Provisional Government of Oregon"",""Members of the Oregon Territorial Legislature"",""1809 births"",""1850 deaths"",""Burials at Hillsboro Pioneer Cemetery"",""Oregon pioneers""]},{""id"" : 252000"",""""begin"": 1891,""end"": 1907,""entity"": ""Mammoth Mountain"",""text"": ""Mammoth Mountain"",""score"": 0.37,""categories"" : [""Lava domes"",""Mountains of Madera County, California"",""Mountains of Mono County, California"",""Volcanoes of Madera County, California"",""Volcanoes of Mono County, California"",""Inyo National Forest"",""Mountains of the Sierra Nevada (U.S.)""]},{""id"" : 13681879"",""""begin"": 2184,""end"": 2191,""entity"": ""Living on the Edge (UK TV series)"",""text"": ""judders"",""score"": 0.50,""categories"" : []},{""id"" : 673717"",""""begin"": 2312,""end"": 2322,""entity"": ""David B.

But its origins are murky.storyThe story, which has been regurgitated by numerous websites, goes like this:David’s family were farmers for decades but … an ancestor had sold off their 80-acre farm to a relative who did not have their best interest in mind, which upset the whole family. But David was determined to win it back again.So when the land was up for sale again through auction, David and his father decided to do whatever possible to win back the farm again.On the auction day, more than 200 farmers were present there, David and his dad thought their chances were slim to win it, but decided to give it their best shot.But what the farmers did next surprised David and his family.When the auctioneer started the auction, David and his father placed their bid, but not a single of the other farmers spoke up.It turned out that more than 200 farmers had a change of heart about the land and decided to not bid for the land, so that the young farmer could win it back for his family.David’s family were farmers for decades but … an ancestor had sold off their 80-acre farm to a relative who did not have their best interest in mind, which upset the whole family.

19,,snopes,,"U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren said or argued to the effect that """"taxpayers must fund sex reassignment surgery.""""",2019-10-02,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/elizabeth-warren-sex-reassignment/,,,,"In September and October 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the veracity of reports that claimed U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren had said or argued to the effect that “taxpayers must fund sex reassignment surgery.”On Aug. 14, the right-leaning website OneNewsNow published an article with the headline, “Warren: Taxpayers Must Fund Sex Reassignment Surgery,” which reported that:article“Democratic presidential primary candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) launched her fight via social media to have taxpayer dollars fund ‘gender-affirming healthcare’ so that transgender Americans can have ‘free’ sex-changing surgery.“‘Everyone should be able to access high-quality, affordable, gender-affirming health care, but the Trump administration is trying to roll back important protections for trans Americans,’ Warren tweeted Tuesday. ‘Help fight back by leaving a comment for HHS in protest.'”Everyone should be able to access high-quality, affordable, gender-affirming health care. But the Trump administration is trying to roll back important protections for trans Americans. Help fight back by leaving a comment for HHS in protest: https://t.co/pKDcOqbsc7— Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) August 13, 2019Everyone should be able to access high-quality, affordable, gender-affirming health care. But the Trump administration is trying to roll back important protections for trans Americans. Help fight back by leaving a comment for HHS in protest: https://t.co/pKDcOqbsc7https://t.co/pKDcOqbsc7— Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) August 13, 2019August 13, 2019 Warren’s tweet included a link to the website Protect Trans Health, a campaign run by the Transgender Law Center and the National Center for Transgender Equality. The purpose of that campaign was to solicit and convey criticism to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) about its controversial move to repeal an Obama-era rule that prohibits healthcare and insurance providers from discriminating against trans individuals. Protect Trans HealthCenterCenterSo the source cited by OneNewsNow did not involve Warren saying, “Taxpayers must fund sex reassignment surgery.” The phrasing of the website’s headline may have given some readers the impression it was a direct quote, even though OneNewsNow did not actually use quotation marks. It might also have led some to believe Warren had proposed that all sex-reassignment surgeries must be taxpayer-funded, which is not the case.allNonetheless, an examination of the record, and confirmation from Warren’s 2020 presidential campaign, make it clear that she does indeed support covering sex-reassignment surgery under taxpayer-funded programs like Medicaid, as well as full legal access to the surgery, under private health insurance and Obamacare. AnalysisWe asked the Warren campaign whether she supports gender-reassignment surgery, and other transition-related services such as medication, being made available at low cost or no cost, under taxpayer-funded programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare (for military service members and veterans), as well as through Obamacare and private health insurance policies. A campaign spokesperson was unequivocal in response: “Yes.” The campaign also directed us to a September 2019 interview Warren conducted with “HIV Plus” magazine, in which she gave further details about her stance on the issue. The interview refers to Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), so a brief explanation is warranted. interviewSection 1557 incorporated existing anti-discrimination law into the Affordable Care Act (ACA). It prohibited healthcare or insurance providers that receive federal funding (include state-by-state Medicaid programs) from discriminating against patients on the basis of their sex, race, religion, national origin, and so on. prohibitedIn 2016, HHS under President Barack Obama implemented a new rule that expanded those protections from discrimination and, most notably, defined sex discrimination as including discrimination on the basis of a patient’s gender identity, as well as their having previously terminated a pregnancy, among other changes.new ruleFederally funded healthcare and insurance providers (including state Medicaid programs) could not deny services or treatment access to individuals on the basis of their gender identity, and could not categorically refuse to cover treatments related to gender transition, such as sex-reassignment surgery. In May 2019, HHS under President Donald Trump proposed another new rule that would largely reverse the Section 1557 expansions brought by the Obama administration, removing gender identity and pregnancy termination from the definition of sex discrimination. It would also add an explicit religious freedom exemption from the requirements of Section 1557. The department wrote in a press release:proposedwrote“In 2016, HHS issued a new rule that redefined discrimination ‘on the basis of sex’ to include termination of pregnancy and gender identity which it defined as one’s internal sense of being ‘male, female, neither, or a combination of male and female.’ In response to a subsequent lawsuit by several states and healthcare entities, on December 31, 2016, a federal court preliminarily enjoined the rule’s gender identity and termination of pregnancy provisions on a nationwide basis, finding them contrary to the applicable civil rights law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act.“A second federal court agreed. Because the preliminary injunction continues to be in effect, HHS cannot, and has not since the date of the injunction, enforced the rule’s provisions the court said are likely unlawful. The proposed rule would revise the provisions subject to those injunctions to conform with the plain understanding recognized by the court.”With that context and background in mind, the following is the most relevant exchange from Warren’s September 2019 interview with “HIV Plus” magazine:interviewInterviewer:…If elected, would you support a reinterpretation of Section 1557 of the ACA as covering transgender people and champion the passage of the Equality Act? How would you protect the rights, well-being, and lives of transgender people living in this country, while ensuring that they receive the healthcare and housing necessary to be virally suppressed?”Warren: Discrimination against transgender Americans is unconstitutional and we need to fight back. HHS’s proposed reinterpretation of Section 1557 rolls back critical nondiscrimination protections, allowing health insurance companies to refuse to cover and health care providers to deny health services to transgender people, particularly those with HIV/AIDS, and to those who have had or are seeking an abortion. It also removes requirements to make information language-accessible, which will harm transgender immigrants. As President, I will direct HHS to interpret Section 1557 under its 2016 guidance, to fully uphold civil rights and nondiscrimination protections. I will also direct the CDC to collect accurate data on the health of transgender people and am a co-sponsor of the Equality Act, which bans discrimination against transgender individuals in health care and housing.Interviewer:…If elected, would you support a reinterpretation of Section 1557 of the ACA as covering transgender people and champion the passage of the Equality Act?

I will also direct the CDC to collect accurate data on the health of transgender people and am a co-sponsor of the Equality Act, which bans discrimination against transgender individuals in health care and housing.Warren:Warren’s declaration that she would as president “direct HHS to interpret Section 1557 under its 2016 guidance” means she would enforce, once again, a set of rules that mean sex-reassignment surgery would be covered under federal programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and Tricare, including state-by-state Medicaid programs.includingAs such, it is accurate to claim that Warren does propose and has proposed that taxpayers should cover the cost of some sex-reassignment surgeries, as they do other treatments and services, under those programs.Warren was also one of 31 U.S. Senators who signed on to a June 2019 letter to Trump’s HHS, which opposed and criticized the proposed reversal of the 2016 anti-discrimination enhancements. Warren was joined in signing that latter by fellow presidential candidates and U.S. Senators Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, and Cory Booker. letterConclusionWarren has therefore put on the record, several times in 2019, her support for sex-reassignment surgery being included among the treatments and services covered under taxpayer-funded programs, as well as under Obamacare and private health insurance policies. However, the OneNewsNetwork headline had a tendency to mislead some readers who may have interpreted its phrasing to mean that Warren had said, word-for-word, “taxpayers must fund sex reassignment surgery,” or that she had advocated taxpayers must fund any and all sex reassignment surgery, rather than simply adding one more procedure to the list of procedures taxpayers already fund under Medicaid and similar federal programs.any and allAs such, we issue a rating of “Mostly True.”",[],"[{""id"" : 290195"",""""begin"": 124,""end"":

20,,snopes,,A president under impeachment is prohibited from issuing pardons.,2019-10-01,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/pardon-during-impeachment/,,,,"Following U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s September 2019 announcement of a formal impeachment inquiry into U.S. President Donald Trump, we received questions asking if the president is blocked from issuing pardons during an impeachment investigation. The answer, unequivocally, is no. Asked of this assertion, Michael McConnell, director of the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School, told us by email “no basis for it whatsoever” exists.Michael McConnellAs we discussed in an earlier explainer about the president’s potential ability to self-pardon, very few limits exist on presidential pardon power. Based on social media comments, it appears that at least some of this misconception may stem from a misreading of the U.S. Constitution. Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution reads, in part, “The President […] shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment”:self-pardonSection 2,  “Except in cases of impeachment,” is not, as some have taken it, a Constitutional requirement that no pardons be issued during a presidential impeachment. Instead, it is widely understood to prohibit pardons that “restore the standing of a Federal officer who has been impeached and removed from his position.” As such, the claim is “False.”understood",[],"[{""id"" : 147301"",""""begin"": 27,""end"": 39,""entity"": ""Nancy Pelosi"",""text"": ""Nancy Pelosi"",""score"": 0.68,""categories"" : [""1940 births"",""Alumni of women's universities and colleges"",""American people of Italian descent"",""American Roman Catholics"",""California Democratic Party chairs"",""California Democrats"",""Female members of the United States House of Representatives"",""Italian-American culture in Baltimore, Maryland"",""Living people"",""Members of the United States House of Representatives from California"",""Minority Leaders of the United States House of Representatives"",""Pelosi family"",""People from Baltimore, Maryland"",""People from San Francisco, California"",""Speakers of the United States House of Representatives"",""Trinity Washington University alumni"",""Women in California politics""]},{""id"" : 15328"",""""begin"": 82,""end"": 93,""entity"": ""Impeachment"",""text"": ""impeachment"",""score"": 0.32,""categories"" : [""Impeachment"",""Accountability"",""Political terminology of the United States""]},{""id"" : 4848272"",""""begin"": 120,""end"": 132,""entity"": ""Donald Trump"",""text"": ""Donald Trump"",""score"": 0.62,""categories"" : [""Living people"",""1946 births"",""20th-century American businesspeople"",""20th-century American writers"",""21st-century American businesspeople"",""21st-century American writers"",""American billionaires"",""American business writers"",""American casino industry businesspeople"",""American chief executives"",""American construction businesspeople"",""American cosmetics businesspeople"",""American education businesspeople"",""American fashion businesspeople"",""American game show hosts"",""American people of German descent"",""American people of Scottish descent"",""American Presbyterians"",""American real estate businesspeople"",""American reality television producers"",""American restaurateurs"",""American socialites"",""Businesspeople from Florida"",""Businesspeople from New York City"",""Businesspeople in the beverage industry"",""Conspiracy theorists"",""Fordham University alumni"",""New York Military Academy alumni"",""New York Republicans"",""Participants in American reality television series"",""People from Manhattan"",""People from Palm Beach, Florida"",""People from Queens"",""Television producers from New York"",""Trump family"",""United States Football League executives"",""Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania alumni"",""Writers from Florida"",""Writers from New York City"",""Article Feedback 5 Additional Articles""]},{""id"" : 382431"",""""begin"": 365,""end"": 384,""entity"": ""Stanford Law School"",""text"": ""Stanford Law School"",""score"": 0.64,""categories"" : [""ABA-accredited law schools in California"",""Educational institutions established in 1893"",""Stanford Law School"",""Law in the San Francisco Bay Area""]},{""id"" : 31647"",""""begin"": 715,""end"": 741,""entity"": ""Article Two of the United States Constitution"",""text"": ""U.S. Constitution.

21,,snopes,,"The U.S. Constitution states that if a president is impeached by the House but not convicted by the Senate, that person's first term is nullified and they are eligible to run for office two more times.",2019-10-01,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/failed-impeachment-nullify-term/,,,,"As talk of impeachment flooded the internet in September 2019, we came across two rumors concerning the impact of the impeachment process on President Donald Trump’s reelection opportunities.The first held that a president who was impeached by the House, but not convicted by the Senate, could run for office two more times because the failed impeachment would nullify the first term. The second posited that if the House votes to impeach a president, but the Senate doesn’t convict and remove the person from office, the president is barred from running for office again. We’ll take a look at each of those theories below. But first, a quick look at how the impeachment process works. People often use the word “impeachment” when referring to the removal of a president from office. But that’s not exactly how it works. The House of Representatives has the “sole Power of Impeachment,” as stated in Article I, Section 2, Clause 5 of the U.S. Constitution. But it is up to the Senate to convict and remove a president from office. In this way, “impeachment” is roughly akin to bringing formal charges against an individual. It is then up to the Senate to convict the individual on those charges. Article I, Section 2, Clause 5impeachmentThe aforementioned theories both deal with the gray area between impeachment and conviction. In other words, what happens if the president is impeached by the House of Representatives but is not convicted by the Senate?Theory 1: If a president is impeached by the House but not convicted by the Senate, the first presidential term is nullified and the president may run for election two more times. Theory 1: If a president is impeached by the House but not convicted by the Senate, the first presidential term is nullified and the president may run for election two more times. FALSE: This theory has been posited by a few social media users, but it reached a larger audience when it was shared by pizzagate conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec:FALSE: pizzagate conspiracy theoristJack PosobiecThe tweet reads: “These Democrats don’t realize that if they impeach Trump and the Senate doesn’t confirm it then it nullifies Trump’s first term and he gets to run two more times. Read the Constitution, people.” This is not how impeachment works. Before we get to what the Constitution says about impeachment, we can get a glimpse of the hypothetical scenario posited in this tweet by taking a quick look at our country’s recent history.President Bill Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives on Dec. 19, 1998. However, Clinton was not convicted by the Senate. We searched news reports from the time and found no serious reporters, historians, or politicians arguing that the Senate’s failure to convict Clinton literally nullified the president’s previous term and gave him the opportunity to run for office again. The Associated Press reported on Feb. 12, 1999:reportedThe Senate today acquitted William Jefferson Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice, ending a 13-month drama that catapulted an affair with a White House intern into only the second presidential impeachment trial in history. Permitted to finish his term, the 42nd president declared he was “profoundly sorry … for what I said and did.”“This can be and this must be a time of reconciliation and renewal for America,” Clinton said in a brief statement from the White House Rose Garden about two hours after the historic verdict.Chief Justice William Rehnquist pronounced Clinton’s acquittal at 12:39 EST. “It is therefore ordered and adjudged that the said William Jefferson Clinton be and he hereby is acquitted of the charges in the said articles,” he intoned.The Senate today acquitted William Jefferson Clinton of perjury and obstruction of justice, ending a 13-month drama that catapulted an affair with a White House intern into only the second presidential impeachment trial in history.

This text says nothing about a president’s term being “nullified” by an impeachment proceeding. Furthermore, the 22nd amendment of the Constitution explicitly states that “no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.”U.S. Constitution22nd amendmentDoug Pennington, director of communication for the Constitutional Accountability Center, told us in an email that Posobiec’s statement was false:The 22d Amendment alone unequivocally disproves that ridiculous, dangerous claim. The first words of the Amendment state: “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice ….” Donald Trump has been elected once. Provided he isn’t convicted by the Senate in an impeachment trial and disqualified from holding future office, he can run for a second term, and only a second term.That’s enough to negate that dreadful tweet, but anyone who considered some version of that question in good faith would have looked anywhere — literally anywhere — in the Constitution for textual support for the belief that if “[1] they impeach Trump and [2] the Senate doesn’t confirm it then [3] it nullifies Trump’s first term and [4] he gets to run two more times.” Having found absolutely none, instead coming across Article I Section 3 and the 22d Amendment, among other sections, such a good-faith questioner would have concluded that the opposite is true, and would not have made such a claim publicly for fear of spreading disinformation.The 22d Amendment alone unequivocally disproves that ridiculous, dangerous claim.

Theory 2: A president is barred from seeking a second term once impeached. MOSTLY FALSE: A number of social media users seem to be under the impression that Trump would not be able to seek reelection if the House of Representatives impeaches him. One Twitter user, for instance, wrote: “If he gets impeached he won’t be able to run in the next election like he plans to. It would guarantee that we can’t have 4 more years under his leadership.”MOSTLY FALSE: wroteBut that isn’t the case. A president who is impeached by the House but is not convicted by the Senate could still run for reelection. Pennington told us: “Nothing in the Constitution’s language on impeachment prevents a president impeached but not convicted from running for a second of a two-term maximum.”In fact, before House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an official impeachment inquiry into Trump in September 2019, political pundits noted that a “failed” impeachment could help Trump’s reelection efforts.An opinion piece in The Hill noted:notedIf the Democratic majority in the House impeaches the president without broad political consensus in the Senate (and country) to convict the president and remove him from office, impeachment will be weaponized by the president in the 2020 campaign. Trump will argue that liberal Democrats and the news media are out to get him, that he has done nothing wrong, and that you can’t impeach a president who has done a great job. This mantra will play well with his loyal base.If the Democratic majority in the House impeaches the president without broad political consensus in the Senate (and country) to convict the president and remove him from office, impeachment will be weaponized by the president in the 2020 campaign. Trump will argue that liberal Democrats and the news media are out to get him, that he has done nothing wrong, and that you can’t impeach a president who has done a great job. This mantra will play well with his loyal base.However, a bit of truth is offered here. The Constitution explains the country has two penalties for impeachment: removal from office and disqualification “to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States.” If a president is impeached by the House of Representatives, the Senate could convict, remove the president from office, and disqualify the person from holding future office. This scenario, however, falls into some gray area because it has never been tested at the presidential level. It is possible that the Senate could take two separate votes, one on removal from office and one on disqualification from future office, which could result in a president’s removal from office but provide an opportunity to seek reelection. It’s also theoretically possible that a president who has been impeached, convicted, removed, and disqualified, could seek office at a lower level of government. lowerWe asked Pennington about the possibility of a president seeking reelection after the House has impeached and the Senate convicted the person. He told us: A convicted president can be prohibited from again holding office if the Senate so decides, per Article I Section 3, which includes: “Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.” Disqualification is not automatic, but up to the Senate’s discretion.While unsettled, a strong argument exists, however, that members of Congress are not encompassed by the language “Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States.” If so, then perhaps an impeached president could run for the House or Senate. It’s untested.Additionally, some argue (at fn. 23) that an impeached and convicted official who the Senate decided to disqualify from holding future office, per Article 1 Section 3 above, would not be disqualified from holding a state office. Again, untested.More confident saying that a Senate disqualifying a president from holding office after an impeachment conviction would at least prohibit him/her from holding a federal office in either the executive or judicial branches, and at least possibly congressional or state office. A convicted president can be prohibited from again holding office if the Senate so decides, per Article I Section 3, which includes: “Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.” Disqualification is not automatic, but up to the Senate’s discretion.if the Senate so decidesArticle I Section 3While unsettled, a strong argument exists, however, that members of Congress are not encompassed by the language “Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States.” If so, then perhaps an impeached president could run for the House or Senate.

Again, untested.arguenotMore confident saying that a Senate disqualifying a president from holding office after an impeachment conviction would at least prohibit him/her from holding a federal office in either the executive or judicial branches, and at least possibly congressional or state office.To sum up: Although a president is impeached by the House of Representatives, the repercussions of this legal process don’t come to fruition until the Senate votes to convict the president.If that happens, the Senate can vote to remove the president from office and disqualify the person from holding future office. If the Senate does not convict, the president will not be removed from office, nor will the person be prevented from seeking reelection (if he/she has not already reached the two-term limit).Nowhere in the Constitution, however, does it state that a failed impeachment process would “nullify” a presidential term and allow a president to seek extra time in office.",[],"[{""id"" :

In this case, the conspiracy theory was given a major platform in the form of a tweet by Trump that his supporters widely shared:WHO CHANGED THE LONG STANDING WHISTLEBLOWER RULES JUST BEFORE SUBMITTAL OF THE FAKE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT? DRAIN THE SWAMP!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019WHO CHANGED THE LONG STANDING WHISTLEBLOWER RULES JUST BEFORE SUBMITTAL OF THE FAKE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT? DRAIN THE SWAMP!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019September 30, 2019The claim originated on The Federalist website, which published a story on Sept. 27 that was not only inaccurate but played on the “deep state” conspiracy theory, an idea now popular among both fringe fanatics and White House officials alike. It posits that U.S. intelligence agencies are scheming against Trump.The Federaliststoryfringe fanaticsofficialsThe Federalist story implied that the intelligence community changed existing rules so that the “anti-Trump complaint” could be filed on Aug. 12 using secondhand information. “Between May 2018 and August 2019, the intelligence community secretly eliminated a requirement that whistleblowers provide direct, first-hand knowledge of alleged wrongdoings,” The Federalist reported.The Federalist story included purported screenshots of previous and current versions of the Disclosure of Urgent Concern form. The current form allows the whistleblower to check a box indicating that the person either learned of the information firsthand or from others, whereas the previous form contained the following language:But as Julian Sanchez, senior fellow at the libertarian think tank Cato Institute, pointed out, even the previous version shown above doesn’t say there was a “requirement that whistleblowers provide direct, first-hand knowledge of alleged wrongdoings.” The law has never required them to do so.previousSanchez pointed out that the form pictured above contains a “description of the Inspector General’s (IG) standard for making a credibility determination, as required by statute, within 14 days of the submission of a complaint. According to that guidance, the IG would not make a finding of credibility, and thus transmit the complaint to the [Director of National Intelligence], unless the DNI was in possession of direct evidence supporting the claim.”It does not say, Sanchez continued, “that whistleblowers may not submit reports based on secondhand knowledge, but rather that such reports will not be escalated to the DNI unless the IG can obtain more.”The Intelligence Community Inspector General’s Office (ICIG) was forced to issue a statement on Sept. 30 correcting the record. The statement read, in part:statementThe Disclosure of Urgent Concern form the Complainant submitted on August 12, 2019 is the same form the ICIG has had in place since May 24, 2018, which went into effect before Inspector General [Michael] Atkinson entered on duty as the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community on May 29, 2018, following his swearing in as the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community on May 17, 2018. Although the form requests information about whether the Complainant possesses first-hand knowledge about the matter about which he or she is lodging the complaint, there is no such requirement set forth in the statute. In fact, by law the Complainant – or any individual in the Intelligence Community who wants to report information with respect to an urgent concern to the congressional intelligence committees – need not possess first-hand information in order to file a complaint or information with respect to an urgent concern. The ICIG cannot add conditions to the filing of an urgent concern that do not exist in law. Since Inspector General Atkinson entered on duty as the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, the ICIG has not rejected the filing of an alleged urgent concern due to a whistleblower’s lack of first-hand knowledge of the allegations.The Disclosure of Urgent Concern form the Complainant submitted on August 12, 2019 is the same form the ICIG has had in place since May 24, 2018, which went into effect before Inspector General [Michael] Atkinson entered on duty as the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community on May 29, 2018, following his swearing in as the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community on May 17, 2018. Although the form requests information about whether the Complainant possesses first-hand knowledge about the matter about which he or she is lodging the complaint, there is no such requirement set forth in the statute.

Since Inspector General Atkinson entered on duty as the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, the ICIG has not rejected the filing of an alleged urgent concern due to a whistleblower’s lack of first-hand knowledge of the allegations.In other words, the entire premise of The Federalist story is wrong. No requirement exists that whistleblowers provide firsthand knowledge of alleged wrong-doings, and changing the rules would have required an act of Congress.Tom Devine, legal director for the watchdog non-profit Government Accountability Project, called The Federalist story a “shameless legal bluff.”“No bureaucrat has the lawful authority to change the rules of the game for whistleblower rights,” Devine told us. “Not even the president can change that unilaterally.” So how did the claim come about? It’s true that the wording on an explanatory form for whistleblowers was changed, but the rules were not. The ICIG’s statement notes that the wording was revised because “certain language in those forms and, more specifically, the informational materials accompanying the forms, could be read — incorrectly — as suggesting that whistleblowers must possess first-hand information in order to file an urgent concern complaint with the congressional intelligence committees.”Devine added that government whistleblowers who report allegations of wrongdoing based on hearsay are still valuable resources in ferreting out government waste, corruption, and wrongdoing.“If we restricted all credible government investigations to those with whistleblowers who have firsthand information, we’d cancel out 90% of law enforcement activity,” Devine said. “Whistleblower investigations are routinely based on hearsay.”The ICIG’s Sept. 30 statement additionally noted that the whistleblower’s complaint did not contain only secondhand, “unsubstantiated assertions.” The whistleblower “checked two relevant boxes: The first box stated that, ‘I have personal and/or direct knowledge of events or records involved’; and the second box stated that, ‘Other employees have told me about events or records involved.'”In summary, the ICIG statement said: [The] whistleblower submitted the appropriate Disclosure of Urgent Concern form that was in effect as of August 12, 2019, and had been used by the ICIG since May 24, 2018. The whistleblower stated on the form that he or she possessed both first-hand and other information. The ICIG reviewed the information provided as well as other information gathered and determined that the complaint was both urgent and that it appeared credible. From the moment the ICIG received the whistleblower’s filing, the ICIG has worked to effectuate Congress’s intent, and the whistleblower’s intent, within the rule of law. The ICIG will continue in those efforts on behalf of all whistleblowers in the Intelligence Community.[The] whistleblower submitted the appropriate Disclosure of Urgent Concern form that was in effect as of August 12, 2019, and had been used by the ICIG since May 24, 2018.

23,,snopes,,Iran recently passed a law allowing men to marry their daughters.,2019-10-01,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/iran-marry-daughters-law/,,,,"In August 2019, an Indian-based website called The Youth published an article headlined “A controversial Bill passed in Iran, it allows men to marry daughters, draws flak from other nations” that drew inquiries from many Snopes readers:articleThe Youth failed to inform readers of several salient facts about the article, however, including the following:The text of The Youth’s piece had been lifted directly (without attribution) from an article published by The Guardian.The Guardian article copied by The Youth was six years old and therefore did not reflect recent events.The bill referenced in the headline applied to adoptive daughters only, not to daughters in general.The text of The Youth’s piece had been lifted directly (without attribution) from an article published by The Guardian.articleThe Guardian article copied by The Youth was six years old and therefore did not reflect recent events.The bill referenced in the headline applied to adoptive daughters only, not to daughters in general.According to other sources, the issue was actually contrary to the way it was framed in headlines published by Western news outlets such as The Guardian. Marriage between stepparents and stepchildren had not previously been barred under Iranian law, so in February 2013 Iran’s Parliament sought to amend the law and passed a bill incorporating such a ban. Iran’s Guardian Council overrode that bill, though, so the Parliament then revised the bill to allow such marriages, but only if they received additional levels of authorization and approval, according to Al-Monitor:other sourcesGuardian CouncilAl-MonitorIn mid-February 2013, an act was passed by the parliament on “Protection of Children and Adolescents with no guardian (adoption).” In the original act, approved by parliament, marriage between adopted children and their parents was completely banned and it stated that if a foster parent decided to marry his or her adopted child, custody of the child would be taken away from the foster parent.The Guardian Council, however, claimed that this bill was against Sharia and returned it to parliament.The issue stems from traditional and conservative families, in which the adoptive daughter, since she is not related by blood, would have to wear a veil in the home around her adoptive father. Also, adoptive mothers would have to wear the veil around their adoptive sons. Typically, reciting a prayer would have addressed this issue.Because the Guardian Council denied a bill allowing an official ban of this type of marriage, parliament modified the original bill so that marriage between foster parents and their adopted children could take place, however only if it were approved by a judge. Also, according to Title 27 of the revised act, marriage between adopted children and their foster parents could only take place if it were requested by the State Welfare Organization and approved by the court.In mid-February 2013, an act was passed by the parliament on “Protection of Children and Adolescents with no guardian (adoption).” In the original act, approved by parliament, marriage between adopted children and their parents was completely banned and it stated that if a foster parent decided to marry his or her adopted child, custody of the child would be taken away from the foster parent.The Guardian Council, however, claimed that this bill was against Sharia and returned it to parliament.The issue stems from traditional and conservative families, in which the adoptive daughter, since she is not related by blood, would have to wear a veil in the home around her adoptive father.

Also, according to Title 27 of the revised act, marriage between adopted children and their foster parents could only take place if it were requested by the State Welfare Organization and approved by the court.So, rather than lifting an existing ban and “allowing” Iranian men to marry their adoptive daughters, the Iranian Parliament attempted to enact a ban on such marriages, which had not previously been barred under the law. Failing that, they passed a bill imposing some restrictions on those marriages:restrictionsThe original text of Article 27 read: “Whenever the guardian decides to marry, he must submit the personal information of the intended party to the court. In case of marriage, the [relevant] institution is responsible to report the marriage to the court so to ensure the legal conditions for continuation or termination of shared guardianship are decided upon. Note: Marriage during custody or after between the adoptive parent and adopted child is illegal.” However, the revised note to Article 27 now states: “Marriage during the period of custody or thereafter between the adoptive parent and adopted child is illegal unless the court after consulting the [relevant] organization recognizes the marriage as beneficial to the adopted child.”The original text of Article 27 read: “Whenever the guardian decides to marry, he must submit the personal information of the intended party to the court.

There are a lot of absurd laws in the Sharia that no one has ever heard about and no judge ever comes in contact with. It is like opening a can of worms! Until today, no foster parent knew that he could marry his adopted child. Parliament had no reason to feel there is any necessity for such an amendment.”People such as Mohammad Nafriyeh, the vice president in charge of social affairs for the State Welfare Organization, defends this law and considers it a step forward. “Unlike what is being said these days, this amendment in fact puts a stop to the possibility of marriage between foster parents and their adopted children. Previously, however, there was no legal restriction regarding such marriages. This is a step forward.”Another jurist who is critical of this new legislation told Al-Monitor, “The rate of marriages between foster fathers and their adopted daughters is one in 1 million. What does this mean? It means that there was no need to create such mental distress for thousands of families regarding an issue that only happens one in 1 million cases. Yes, if these marriages were the norm, then this amendment could have been considered a step forward. However, given the current circumstances, how can this be considered a step forward?”But this argument was rejected by Mohammad Nafriyeh. In an interview with Iran Labor News Agency, ILNA, he said, “As vice-president of the State Welfare Organization, I can tell you that such marriages are not as rare as one might think. We have had cases like these in the past and based on the information that I have, I consider this amendment to be a step forward which can reduce the number of such marriages in the country.”A jurist in Tehran said, “Marriage between adopted children and foster parents was never banned.

25,,snopes,,"In 2006, an abortion-clinic owner cut the umbilical cord of a baby born alive before """"throwing"""" her in a biohazard bag and putting her remains in """"the trash.""""",2019-09-30,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/23-weeks-baby-abortion/,,,,"We received multiple inquiries from readers in September 2019 about the veracity of widely shared reports that claimed an abortion provider in Florida had disposed of a baby “born alive at 23 weeks” by “throwing her in the trash.”On Sept. 23, the pro-life website LifeNews reported on U.S. Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.), writing:writing“This week, at a hearing on Capitol Hill on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, Congressman Chris Smith, chair of the Pro-Life Caucus, issued the following statement …”The article’s headline claimed: “Baby Born Alive at 23 Weeks Was Gasping for Air. Abortion Clinic Put Baby in a Bag, Threw Her in the Trash.”Smith’s statement came on Sept. 10, during a House minority hearing in Washington, D.C., on the subject of the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection bill, a piece of legislation that would, according to its supporters, enhance the requirements placed upon medical professionals to provide medical care for babies who survive failed abortions and are born alive. Critics say the legislation is legally unnecessary and intended to vilify abortion providers and subject them to unwarranted additional scrutiny.legislationsaySmith, who represents the 4th congressional district of New Jersey and is chair of the Congressional pro-life caucus, used some of his time to raise the case of Sycloria Williams, a Florida woman who underwent a failed abortion and whose baby died shortly after being born alive. His remarks can be watched in full below. The most relevant portion was as follows:“In a Florida abortion clinic, Sycloria Williams delivered a live baby at 23 weeks gestation. The clinic owner took the baby, who was gasping for air, cut her umbilical cord, threw her into a biohazard bag and put the bag in the trash. Heartbroken, Sycloria later had a funeral for her baby girl who she named Shanice.” ﻿﻿﻿Overall, Smith’s description of the events in question, as well as that contained in LifeNews’s headline, contained a mixture of accurate and misleading elements. The following exposition of the facts, and analysis, contains some rather graphic details of a late-term abortion, which some readers may find upsetting.BackgroundIn July 2006, 18-year-old Sycloria Williams engaged the services of an abortion clinic in Hialeah, Florida. According to reports, she was around 23 weeks pregnant when Dr. Pierre Jean-Jacque Renelique performed the first part of the two-part dilation and evacuation abortion procedure.reportsThe next day, Williams returned to the clinic in order to have the pregnancy terminated and the fetus removed from her uterus. Reportedly, Renelique was late in arriving, and Williams went into labor. The baby was delivered alive, so the clinic’s co-owner, Belkis Gonzalez, cut the baby’s umbilical cord and disposed of the baby in a biohazard bag. In an interview with the Florida Catholic newspaper, Williams said of the baby: “She wasn’t moving much. Twitching, gasping for air. She wasn’t crying though, just hissing. Hissing sounds only.”saidThree years later, prosecutors in Miami-Dade County filed two charges against Gonzalez: practicing as a medical professional without a license, resulting in serious bodily injury (for the act of cutting the umbilical cord), a felony that can carry a sentence of up to 15 years in prison; and tampering with evidence for the purpose of making it unavailable in a criminal investigation (for the alleged act of hiding the biozhard bag containing the baby’s remains), a felony that could carry a sentence of up to five years in prison. chargespracticingsentencetamperingsentenceIn charging the clinic’s co-owner, prosecutors alleged she had caused the baby to suffer “brain or spinal damage and/or limitation of neurological, physical or sensory function” when she severed the umbilical cord. Of the second charge, prosecutors provided the following details, claiming Gonzalez had:details“… Unlawfully and feloniously, knowing that a criminal trial or proceeding or an investigation … was pending …, alter, destroy, conceal or remove evidence, to wit: biohazard bags and/or their contents, including the body of S.D.O., a female infant, and/or fetal remains and/or placenta and/or umbilical cord remnants, … with the purpose to impair the verity or availability of said evidence …”In court filings, Gonzalez did not reject the claim that she had disposed of the baby’s remains in a biohazard bag, only that she had deliberately hidden those remains from police searches, in an effort to thwart their investigations. There does not appear to be a substantive dispute over her having disposed of the remains, though we did not find any evidence that she had, specifically, “thrown” the remains into a biohazard bag. That description appears to be an example of poetic license on the part of Rep. Smith, though ultimately the evidence is lacking.   filingsIn court filings, Gonzalez accepted that the baby had been delivered prematurely in the clinic, and that she had personally cut the umbilical cord after that delivery, so this component of the claim made by Smith and LifeNews was accurate. However, Gonzalez denied the charge of causing serious bodily injury by practicing medicine while unlicensed, in part on the basis that the baby was non-viable — an important principle in good-faith ethical and medical debates over late-term abortion and an important factual element that Smith and others later omitted from their accounts of the Williams case. filingsnon-viableAnalysisIn early 2011, Gonzalez filed a motion to dismiss the charges against her. In that motion, her attorneys cited testimony provided by two medical experts for the prosecution, both of whom agreed that the baby, which one estimated to have a gestational age of 21.5 weeks, was non-viable when she was delivered, meaning she could never have survived outside the womb for more than mere moments, no matter what attempts were made to save her life.motionThe motion quoted Dr. William Smalling, a neonatologist and medical expert for the prosecution, as saying in deposition:“After reviewing the charts [presented by law enforcement], it was deemed that the fetus was about twenty-one and a half weeks. And based on estimation by the pathology report and the ultrasound, a fetus of that age would not be — would be considered non-viable, which means it wasn’t mature enough to survive outside of the uterus regardless of whatever intervention was done. So I felt that cutting the umbilical cord played no role on [sic] the survival of the infant, because the baby was deemed to be not able to survive.”The second prosecution expert, obstetrician and gynecologist Dr. Glenn Salkind, wrote in an affidavit that “the fetus was not viable at the time of the termination of pregnancy.” Gonzalez also quoted from the death certificate produced for the infant, which wrote that “the medical examiner concluded the cause of death was extreme prematurity and the manner of death to be natural.”Whatever one’s subjective moral viewpoint, a non-trivial difference does exist between a set of circumstances in which a fetus, intended for abortion, is instead delivered alive and breathing and has a chance of surviving with the help of medical intervention, as compared to a fetus that perhaps momentarily struggles to gain breath or twitches but has no realistic prospect of surviving beyond a couple of minutes, regardless of what life-saving efforts take place. This is not to defend or condemn one course of action over another, including the decisions made by clinic staff including Gonzalez, but rather to simply point out that a difference does exist where fetal viability comes into question.From an ethical point of view, it is worth noting that, at the time she cut the umbilical cord and disposed of the baby, Gonzalez may or may not have been aware of the fact that, as medical professionals later attested, the fetus was non-viable and had no realistic hope of survival. laterEven if her own experience and knowledge reliably informed her that the fetus could not survive, cutting the umbilical cord and disposing of the remains was not the only course of action immediately available to her. She could, for example, have endeavored to provide as much comfort as possible to the baby in the circumstances, or sought a second opinion from a licensed medical professional, and so on. In the context of this fact check, and the claims made by Smith, LifeNews, and others, it is important to note that their description of the incident — the baby was “born alive” and “gasping for air” before being disposed of by clinic staff — likely gave many readers the impression that the baby had a chance of survival and may well have lived had Gonzalez not taken the actions she did. That was not the case, as attested by medical experts hired by prosecutors against Gonzalez, and therefore this element of those descriptions had a tendency to be misleading. In 2011, prosecutors accepted Gonzalez’ motion to dismiss the charges against her, writing that the evidence available was not sufficient to refute the defendant’s claims. Eleventh Circuit Court Judge John Thornton dismissed the charges against Gonzalez in March 2011. Williams also took a civil case against the clinic and several of its staff (including Gonzalez and Renelique, the doctor who was schedule to perform the second part of the abortion procedure in July 2006). She sued them for professional malpractice in 2009, but the case was dismissed in 2012. dismissed",[],"[{""id"" : 765"",""""begin"": 122,""end"": 130,""entity"": ""Abortion"",""text"": ""abortion"",""score"": 0.31,""categories"" : [""Abortion"",""Core issues in ethics"",""Gender studies"",""Fertility"",""Human reproduction"",""Ethically disputed practices""]},{""id"" : 37600900"",""""begin"": 241,""end"": 248,""entity"": ""Anti-abortion movements"",""text"": ""pro-life"",""score"": 0.40,""categories"" : [""Pro-life movement"",""Abortion"",""Political opposition""]},{""id"" : 43993621"",""""begin"": 257,""end"": 265,""entity"": ""Life (news agency, Russia)"",""text"": ""LifeNews"",""score"": 0.50,""categories"" : []},{""id"" : 694740"",""""begin"": 285,""end"": 296,""entity"": ""Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)"",""text"": ""Chris Smith"",""score"": 0.55,""categories"" : [""1953 births"",""Living people"",""American pro-life activists"",""American Roman Catholics"",""Eagle Scouts"",""Members of the United States House of Representatives from New Jersey"",""New Jersey Democrats"",""New Jersey Republicans"",""People from Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey"",""People from Woodbridge Township, New Jersey"",""People from Rahway, New Jersey"",""The College of New Jersey alumni""]},{""id"" : 31979"",""""begin"": 343,""end"": 355,""entity"": ""United States Capitol"",""text"": ""Capitol Hill"",""score"": 0.47,""categories"" : [""United States Capitol"",""Government buildings completed in 1811"",""National Historic Landmarks in Washington, D.C."",""Terminating vistas in the United States"",""World Digital Library related""]},{""id"" : 765"",""""begin"": 373,""end"": 381,""entity"": ""Abortion"",""text"": ""Abortion"",""score"": 0.35,""categories"" : [""Abortion"",""Core issues in ethics"",""Gender studies"",""Fertility"",""Human reproduction"",""Ethically disputed practices""]},{""id"" : 694740"",""""begin"": 419,""end"": 430,""entity"": ""Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)"",""text"": ""Chris Smith"",""score"": 0.54,""categories"" : [""1953 births"",""Living people"",""American pro-life activists"",""American Roman Catholics"",""Eagle Scouts"",""Members of the United States House of Representatives from New Jersey"",""New Jersey Democrats"",""New Jersey Republicans"",""People from Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey"",""People from Woodbridge Township, New Jersey"",""People from Rahway, New Jersey"",""The College of New Jersey alumni""]},{""id"" : 37600900"",""""begin"": 444,""end"": 451,""entity"": ""Anti-abortion movements"",""text"": ""Pro-Life"",""score"": 0.45,""categories"" : [""Pro-life movement"",""Abortion"",""Political opposition""]},{""id"" : 765"",""""begin"": 569,""end"": 577,""entity"": ""Abortion"",""text"": ""Abortion"",""score"": 0.30,""categories"" : [""Abortion"",""Core issues in ethics"",""Gender studies"",""Fertility"",""Human reproduction"",""Ethically disputed practices""]},{""id"" : 108956"",""""begin"": 695,""end"": 708,""entity"": ""Washington, D.C."",""text"": ""Washington, D.C"",""score"": 0.37,""categories"" : [""Capital districts and territories"",""Capitals in North America"",""Planned capitals"",""Planned cities in the United States"",""Populated places established in 1790"",""Populated places in Washington, D.C. with African American majority populations"",""Populated places on the Potomac River"",""States and territories established in 1790"",""Washington, D.C."",""Washington metropolitan area""]},{""id"" : 765"",""""begin"": 742,""end"": 750,""entity"": ""Abortion"",""text"": ""Abortion"",""score"": 0.30,""categories"" : [""Abortion"",""Core issues in ethics"",""Gender studies"",""Fertility"",""Human reproduction"",""Ethically disputed practices""]},{""id"" : 765"",""""begin"": 1055,""end"": 1063,""entity"": ""Abortion"",""text"": ""abortion"",""score"": 0.37,""categories"" : [""Abortion"",""Core issues in ethics"",""Gender studies"",""Fertility"",""Human reproduction"",""Ethically disputed practices""]},{""id"" : 37600900"",""""begin"": 1240,""end"": 1247,""entity"": ""Anti-abortion movements"",""text"": ""pro-life"",""score"": 0.40,""categories"" : [""Pro-life movement"",""Abortion"",""Political opposition""]},{""id"" : 256024"",""""begin"": 1502,""end"": 1518,""entity"": ""Abortion in the United States"",""text"": ""Florida abortion"",""score"": 0.62,""categories"" : [""Abortion in the United States"",""United States law""]},{""id"" : 21946942"",""""begin"": 1639,""end"": 1646,""entity"": ""Air Cut"",""text"": ""air, cut"",""score"": 0.35,""categories"" : [""Curved Air albums"",""1973 albums"",""Albums produced by Martin Rushent"",""Warner Bros.

But the video actually shows a professional motorcycle rider, Colby Raha, performing a planned stunt as police tried to stop him. professionalThe back story of the stunt seen in this video actually starts in 2004, when motorcyclist Colin Morrison jumped across this same gap. Morrison’s stunt, which was featured in the PowerBand Films video “On the Pipe 1,” also featured a moving train:On the Pipe 1Motorcyclist Kyle Katsandris attempted to recreate Morrison’s jump in 2017 for Powerband Films video “On the Pipe 7.” Katsandris’ attempt, however, was unsuccessful and landed the 24-year-old stuntman in the hospital:attemptedThe Los Angeles Times reported:reportedA motocross rider whose jump over a freeway in Riverside County last month became an Internet video sensation was critically injured Sunday after performing a dangerous off-road stunt over train tracks, police saidKyle Katsandris, 24, of San Clemente, planned to jump “an expanse across railroad tracks” in the 500 block of West Los Angeles Avenue, according to the Simi Valley Police Department. But at some point, the stunt went horribly wrong.Katsandris overshot his landing zone and crashed, said police Cmdr.

Robert Arabian.Emergency responders were called to the scene and Katsandris was taken to a hospital in “critical, but stable condition,” police said.A few months after Katsandris’ unsuccessful attempt, Raha turned up to this location for a turn at the jump. But it appears police were alerted to Raha’s attempt and tried to stop him from jumping the tracks.The stunts by Morrison, Katsandris, and Raha are all featured in the following clip from Powerband Films:We should note these stunts typically require a lot of preparation, not only for the stunt itself, but also for the camera crew to work out a plan to get the best footage. A behind-the-scenes video for “On The Pipe 7” shows that the Powerband Films camera crews used drones, and sometimes helicopters, in order to film these stunts. If you look closely on the hill near Raha’s landing spot, you can see a person filming the stunt.behind-the-scenesTo sum up: This video does not show an ordinary citizen making an impromptu decision to evade police by jumping over a train track. The viral video instead appears to show police officers trying to stop a planned stunt shortly after another motorcyclist was injured performing a similar jump. We reached out to Raha, Powerband Films, and the Simi Valley Police Department, and we will update this article if more information becomes available.",[],"[{""id"" : 4434812"",""""begin"": 0,""end"": 11,""entity"": ""Viral video"",""text"": ""Viral video"",""score"": 0.33,""categories"" : [""Viral marketing"",""Viral videos"",""Buzzwords""]},{""id"" : 9988187"",""""begin"": 249,""end"": 256,""entity"": ""Twitter"",""text"": ""twitter"",""score"": 0.30,""categories"" : [""2006 establishments in the United States"",""Companies based in San Francisco, California"",""Internet companies of the United States"",""Internet properties established in 2006"",""Privately held companies based in California"",""Real-time web"",""Social networking services"",""Text messaging"",""Twitter"",""Social networking websites"",""IOS software"",""Android (operating system) software""]},{""id"" : 9988187"",""""begin"": 392,""end"": 399,""entity"": ""Twitter"",""text"": ""twitter"",""score"": 0.32,""categories"" : [""2006 establishments in the United States"",""Companies based in San Francisco, California"",""Internet companies of the United States"",""Internet properties established in 2006"",""Privately held companies based in California"",""Real-time web"",""Social networking services"",""Text messaging"",""Twitter"",""Social networking websites"",""IOS software"",""Android (operating system) software""]},{""id"" : 273319"",""""begin"": 1160,""end"": 1177,""entity"": ""Los Angeles Times"",""text"": ""Los Angeles Times"",""score"": 0.51,""categories"" : [""Los Angeles Times"",""National newspapers published in the United States"",""Newspapers published in California"",""Newspapers published in the Greater Los Angeles Area"",""Publications established in 1881"",""Pulitzer Prize winning newspapers"",""Tribune Company subsidiaries"",""Worth Bingham Prize recipients"",""1881 establishments in California""]},{""id"" : 254052"",""""begin"": 1197,""end"": 1206,""entity"": ""Motocross"",""text"": ""motocross"",""score"": 0.34,""categories"" : [""Motocross""]},{""id"" : 27003186"",""""begin"": 1242,""end"": 1258,""entity"": ""Riverside County, California"",""text"": ""Riverside County"",""score"": 0.36,""categories"" : [""California counties"",""Riverside County, California"",""1893 establishments in the United States""]},{""id"" : 656317"",""""begin"": 1512,""end"": 1528,""entity"": ""Westside (Los Angeles County)"",""text"": ""West Los Angeles"",""score"": 0.39,""categories"" : [""Los Angeles County, California regions""]},{""id"" : 10041392"",""""begin"": 1553,""end"": 1582,""entity"": ""Simi Valley Police Department"",""text"": ""Simi Valley Police Department"",""score"": 0.53,""categories"" : [""Organizations based in Simi Valley, California"",""Municipal police departments of California"",""Government of Ventura County, California""]},{""id"" : 254052"",""""begin"": 1843,""end"": 1852,""entity"": ""Motocross"",""text"": ""motocross"",""score"": 0.31,""categories"" : [""Motocross""]},{""id"" : 27003186"",""""begin"": 1888,""end"": 1904,""entity"": ""Riverside County, California"",""text"": ""Riverside County"",""score"": 0.35,""categories"" : [""California counties"",""Riverside County, California"",""1893 establishments in the United States""]},{""id"" : 656317"",""""begin"": 2158,""end"": 2174,""entity"": ""Westside (Los Angeles County)"",""text"": ""West Los Angeles"",""score"": 0.39,""categories"" : [""Los Angeles County, California regions""]},{""id"" : 10041392"",""""begin"": 2199,""end"": 2228,""entity"": ""Simi Valley Police Department"",""text"": ""Simi Valley Police Department"",""score"": 0.53,""categories"" : [""Organizations based in Simi Valley, California"",""Municipal police departments of California"",""Government of Ventura County, California""]},{""id"" : 41230247"",""""begin"": 2673,""end"": 2691,""entity"": ""Jumping the Tracks (+/- album)"",""text"": ""jumping the tracks"",""score"": 0.50,""categories"" : []},{""id"" : 4434812"",""""begin"": 3363,""end"": 3374,""entity"": ""Viral video"",""text"": ""viral video"",""score"": 0.32,""categories"" : [""Viral marketing"",""Viral videos"",""Buzzwords""]},{""id"" : 23692256"",""""begin"": 3391,""end"": 3398,""entity"": ""The T.O.

27,,snopes,,U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham argued in 1999 that a crime wasn't necessary for presidential impeachment.,2019-09-30,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/lindsey-graham-crime-impeach/,,,,"An old quote supposedly uttered by U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham about the requirements for presidential impeachment is frequently shared on social media in response to the South Carolina lawmaker’s staunch defense of President Donald Trump:shareddefenseYou don’t even have to be convicted of a crime to lose your job in this constitutional republic if this body determines that your conduct as a public official is clearly out of bounds in your role. Impeachment is not about punishment. Impeachment is about cleansing the office. Impeachment is about restoring honor and integrity to the office.You don’t even have to be convicted of a crime to lose your job in this constitutional republic if this body determines that your conduct as a public official is clearly out of bounds in your role. Impeachment is not about punishment. Impeachment is about cleansing the office. Impeachment is about restoring honor and integrity to the office.This is a genuine quote from Graham. Graham was one of 13 U.S. House Republicans from the judiciary committee who served as a “manager” (similar to a prosecutor) during the impeachment trial of then-President Bill Clinton. As Graham made his case for Clinton’s impeachment on Jan. 16, 1999, the South Carolina lawmaker explained his thoughts on what constituted a “high crime” and argued that a president’s being convicted of a crime was not required for impeachment.The viral quote can be heard in the following clip from C-Span:Graham hit on a few other relevant topics during this speech. For instance, Graham talked about what he believed constituted a “high crime”:speech“What’s a high crime? How about if an important person hurts somebody of low means? It’s not very scholarly. But I think it’s the truth. I think that’s what they meant by high crimes. Doesn’t even have to be a crime.”“What’s a high crime? How about if an important person hurts somebody of low means? It’s not very scholarly. But I think it’s the truth. I think that’s what they meant by high crimes. Doesn’t even have to be a crime.”Graham also acknowledged the gravity of Clinton’s impeachment trial, noting that all presidents to come after Clinton would be held to the same standards:I think we’re putting a burden on the presidency and we should consider it that way. That if you determine that the conduct in the crimes in this case are high crimes you need to do so knowing that you’re placing a burden on every future occupant of that office and the office itself. So do so cautiously. Because one branch of the government should never put a burden on another branch of the government that’s not fair and they can’t bear. Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, if you decided from the conduct of this president to henceforth any officeholder who occupies the office of president will have this burden to bear, Let me tell you what it is: Don’t lie under oath to a federal grand jury when many in the country are begging you not to. Can the occupant bear that burden?I think we’re putting a burden on the presidency and we should consider it that way.

We also searched a cached version of her page to see if the tweet had recently been deleted, but came up empty there, as well. timelineWhile we found a number of people sharing this message, they all did so by posting a text version of this message or by posting the above-displayed screenshot. We were unable to find any instances of a person retweeting the actual tweet link, nor any links to a genuine message that was recently deleted. actualThis tweet is also suspicious because the image indicates it was sent with “Twitter for Android.” Lewinksy’s tweets, however, are most often sent via iPhone. iPhoneThis fake tweet appears to have been created by the @electorotting (notice watermark in upper right-hand corner of image), an Instagram page that frequently posts political memes and jokes.

30,,snopes,,NASA and NOAA faked climate data in the GISTEMP global temperature record to exaggerate global warming.,2019-10-03,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/global-warming-data-faked/,,,,"Since 2014, climate-change deniers have squeezed millions of views, Facebook shares, and Twitter retweets by retelling a story alleging the discovery of “faked” NASA data designed to “fit a climate change narrative.” Though copied almost wholesale from a blog post, the version of the story that has had the most online traction was published on the one-stop conspiracy theory/supplement shop that goes by the name Natural News. The article suggested:squeezedblog postsuggestedIn what might be the largest scientific fraud ever uncovered, NASA and the NOAA have been caught red-handed altering historical temperature data to produce a “climate change narrative” that defies reality. […] We now know that historical temperature data for the continental United States were deliberately altered by NASA and NOAA scientists in a politically-motivated attempt to rewrite history and claim global warming is causing U.S. temperatures to trend upward.In what might be the largest scientific fraud ever uncovered, NASA and the NOAA have been caught red-handed altering historical temperature data to produce a “climate change narrative” that defies reality. […] We now know that historical temperature data for the continental United States were deliberately altered by NASA and NOAA scientists in a politically-motivated attempt to rewrite history and claim global warming is causing U.S. temperatures to trend upward.There is a lot to unpack here, but the first thing you need to know is records of global surface temperatures are constantly refined based on the addition of new data, fresh statistical analyses, or new historical insight into the history of a specific source of data. Reporting on such a shift as something to “uncover” betrays a potentially willful ignorance of how climate science operates. These changes are publicly reported, based on stated scientific criteria, and subjected to rigorous internal and external peer review.constantly refinedWhere is this coming from?The “smoking gun” concerns a climate record known as the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP). These records are based on a massive global dataset of temperature stations from around the world, combining several collections of data originally collected by individual weather stations. The record provides “a measure of the changing global surface temperature with monthly resolution for the period since 1880, when a reasonably global distribution of meteorological stations was established.”GISTEMPprovidesTo argue for evidence of “faked” data, Natural News, as well as the original blog post, highlighted a version of the GISTEMP record for the United States first published in 1999, comparing it to one published later, in 2012. The record, these sources point out, has shifted:(These charts plot how far off each year’s average U.S. temperature differs from the average temperature for the entire period 1951–1980; the frame labeled “a” is from 1999.)chartsIt should be no shock that the data shifted following 1999, as illustrated graphically in the above diagram, because NASA published multiple papers in 1999 and 2001 about these changes and why they were made. Links to these papers can be found on the NASA website, which also publicly summarizes the changes in several other places.multiplepapers summarizesWhy adjust climate data?Writing for the climate information website Skeptical Science, Berkeley Earth research scientist Zeke Hausfather, whose work (in part) independently analyzes adjustments made by government agencies’ climate records, explained the need for making adjustments to such datasets in general. A primary misconception, he argues, is that an “unadjusted global temperature record” — which necessarily has to take into account not only the temperature reading at a given recording station, but also how to translate that data spatially to come up with a single annual or monthly number — is not really a thing that exists to begin with:Zeke HausfatherexplainedThere are a number of folks who question the need for adjustments at all. Why not just use raw temperatures, they ask, since those are pure and unadulterated? The problem is that … there is really no such thing as a pure and unadulterated temperature record. Temperature stations in the U.S. are mainly operated by volunteer observers (the Cooperative Observer Network, or co-op stations for short). Many of these stations were set up in the late 1800s and early 1900s as part of a national network of weather stations, focused on measuring day-to-day changes in the weather rather than decadal-scale changes in the climate.Nearly every single station in the network in the network has been moved at least once over the last century, with many having 3 or more distinct moves. Most of the stations have changed [the type of instruments used]. Observation times have shifted from afternoon to morning at most stations since 1960, as part of an effort by the National Weather Service to improve precipitation measurements.There are a number of folks who question the need for adjustments at all.

Observation times have shifted from afternoon to morning at most stations since 1960, as part of an effort by the National Weather Service to improve precipitation measurements.So what were the issues that led to changes between the 1999 record and the later record? According to NASA’s GISTEMP website, “Starting in the 1990s, the methodology took into account documented non-climatic biases in the raw data and eliminated or corrected unrealistic outliers.” The goal of these adjustments is to remove shoddy data from the dataset using pre-established methodologies, not to fit a “climate change narrative.”AccordingThese “non-climatic biases” include things like stations taking temperature measurements at different times of day, stations physically moving locations (sometimes to a different elevation), and other artifacts that produce change in a record not attributable to climate or weather. These non-climatic biases were identified and their method of adjustment described in a publicly available 2001 paper found, among other places, on NASA’s website. They included:includedTime of observation: Not all stations collect observations at the same time, and some stations — most significantly in the United States — have changed the time at which data is collected over time. Correcting for these effects is the most significant adjustment made to the GISTEMP dataset post-1999.Station location history: Sometimes stations move to another location, affecting the record. Post-1999 records take this into account.Change in thermometer type: A well-defined shift in data came from a change from liquid-in-glass thermometers to the maximum-minimum temperature system (MMTS). Post-1999 records take this into account.Urban heat effect: Densely populated urban areas retain heat more than rural areas. An increase in stations in urban areas over time, for example, would create a false warming trend. Post 1999 records take this into account as well.Time of observation: Not all stations collect observations at the same time, and some stations — most significantly in the United States — have changed the time at which data is collected over time.

The methods used and their effect on the data are all disclosed online. However the issues described above are largely moot at the time of this writing in 2019. The GISTEMP analyses at issue above concern a formulation of the dataset (GISTEMP v3) that has been replaced by an improved model named GISTEMP v4, which includes a much larger set of data and a whole other set of adjustments.employ modelsGISTEMP v4“Caught red-handed”All told, the most significant effect of all these changes came from the time-of-day adjustments. Collectively, the adjustments served to produce a slightly increased warming trend in the United States record compared to the earlier records.warming trendThe largest adjustments are the time of observation debiasing and station history adjustment, each of which increases the mean warming over the United States by about 0.15ºC over the 100 years. The net of all five adjustments to the … record is a warming of about 0.3ºCThe largest adjustments are the time of observation debiasing and station history adjustment, each of which increases the mean warming over the United States by about 0.15ºC over the 100 years. The net of all five adjustments to the … record is a warming of about 0.3ºCTo suggest — 14 years after the fact — that identifying publicly discussed adjustments to raw data whose methods have been published in peer-reviewed journals represents catching scientists “red-handed” in “the largest scientific fraud ever uncovered” exposes only the ignorance of the author, not some nefarious sleight of hand by climate scientists. As such, the claim is rated “False.”",[],"[{""id"" : 7529378"",""""begin"": 65,""end"": 73,""entity"": ""Facebook"",""text"": ""Facebook"",""score"": 0.37,""categories"" : [""Facebook"",""Android

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggested eating babies to combat climate change at a town hall event.,2019-10-04,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/babies-climate-change-aoc/,,,,"An Oct. 3, 2019, town hall event in New York City hosted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., was going smoothly until a woman in a black jacket stood up and started rambling her fears about apocalyptic climate change. Then she took her jacket off, revealing a T-shirt that read, “Save the planet. Eat the children.”T-shirtThe woman said she was glad Ocasio-Cortez supported the Green New Deal but stated it was not enough. “Your new campaign slogan has to be this,” she stated, taking her jacket off and revealing the shirt. “We got to start eating babies. We don’t have enough time. … Even if you would bomb Russia, we still have too many people, too much pollution!”Words and images from the event shared online prompted reactions from many, including U.S. President Donald Trump and his eldest son, Donald Jr.includingSeems like a normal AOC supporter to me. https://t.co/NWVMRD0wsl— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 4, 2019Seems like a normal AOC supporter to me. https://t.co/NWVMRD0wslhttps://t.co/NWVMRD0wsl— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 4, 2019October 4, 2019During the town hall, Ocasio-Cortez responded to the woman by talking about the need for positive solutions to climate change and concluding, “We are never beyond hope” before quickly moving on to another question.Although some on the political right criticized her response, Ocasio-Cortez followed up on Twitter by explaining that she had been operating under the assumption that the woman was mentally ill and in crisis.somerightThis person may have been suffering from a mental condition and it’s not okay that the right-wing is mocking her and potentially make her condition or crisis worse. Be a decent human being and knock it off.— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 4, 2019This person may have been suffering from a mental condition and it’s not okay that the right-wing is mocking her and potentially make her condition or crisis worse. Be a decent human being and knock it off.— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 4, 2019October 4, 2019It turned out the woman in question was neither an Ocasio-Cortez supporter nor a person having a mental-health emergency but apparently acting at the behest of a group called Lyndon LaRouche PAC. The stunt was meant to troll Ocasio-Cortez.groupHistorian Matthew Sweet described the group as a “bizarre political cult” in an interview with The Washington Post about the incident. Sweet, who has studied the group’s history, told the Post that the woman’s stunt fell in line with their standard operating procedures. “The tactic,” Sweet told the Post, “is you go to a political meeting and you create a disturbance that disrupts the meeting, and more importantly, that creates a kind of chaos.”describedThe group, dubbed LaRouchians, has been around for decades, and was founded by conspiracy crank Lyndon LaRouche, who died in February 2019 at the age of 96 after building a “worldwide following based on conspiracy theories, economic doom, anti-Semitism, homophobia and racism.”buildingLaRouche’s conspiracy theories involve proffering claims that the Queen of England controls the international drug trade and that Adolf Hitler, whose forces bombed England in World War II, was a British agent.controlsagent",[],"[{""id"" : 645042"",""""begin"": 33,""end"": 46,""entity"": ""New York City"",""text"": ""New York City"",""score"": 0.40,""categories"" : [""New York

32,,snopes,,Videos have captured strange apocalyptic sounds coming from the sky all around the world.,2015-04-30,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-sound-of-apocalypse/,,,,"On 10 April 2015, the web site Latin Post shared a video purportedly featuring “strange apocalyptic sounds coming from the sky all around the world.” That video comprises clips from various videos uploaded to YouTube between 2011 and 2013; and while it’s impossible for us to offer a comprehensive explanation covering every clip seen in that video, we can provide a skeptical look about the alleged “apocalyptic noises” it references.Latin PostLatin PostThis video claims that there has been creepy strange noises around the world, many of the comments under these videos are very “world coming to an end” type comments. People are claiming they are trumpets playing. There is no scientific explanation for these noises. I just want to know it it’s nonsense or not.This video claims that there has been creepy strange noises around the world, many of the comments under these videos are very “world coming to an end” type comments. People are claiming they are trumpets playing. There is no scientific explanation for these noises. I just want to know it it’s nonsense or not.Unusual and unexplained noises are recorded in various locations around the world from time to time. While the specific origins of all such sounds may not yet be known, most scientific research points to natural causes such as tidal waves, methane explosions, underground earthquakes, or shifting sand dunes as explanations for these aural phenomena:researchThere are many potential explanations, according to David Hill, a scientist at the US Geological Survey, who wrote a recent scientific review paper rounding up the causes of mystery booms. In coastal regions, for instance, large bangs may accompany humungous waves hitting the cliffs; reports of thunderous sounds are apparently common among big-wave surfers in the US.Hill suspects that earthquakes are to blame in the majority of cases. He’s talking from experience; while in California’s Mammoth Mountain he was surrounded by a muffled booming sound, despite feeling no shaking. On inspecting his instruments he found evidence of small earthquakes less than 4 km (2.9 miles) below the surface. Whereas sounds of deeper earthquakes may be too low for human hearing, he has calculated that judders near the surface could transmit audible noises of the cracking crust.There are many potential explanations, according to David Hill, a scientist at the US Geological Survey, who wrote a recent scientific review paper rounding up the causes of mystery booms.

Whereas sounds of deeper earthquakes may be too low for human hearing, he has calculated that judders near the surface could transmit audible noises of the cracking crust.Although it is likely that “strange apocalyptic” booming sounds seemingly issuing from the sky have an earthly origin, USGS scientist David Hill said that it’s also possible some of these noises originate from above:You might think it unlikely that we would miss the flash of a meteor, but it’s not impossible, as Hill notes: ‘Because of the time required for a sonic shock wave to reach the Earth’s surface from the upper atmosphere, the visible trace of the meteor has usually vanished before its sonic boom is heard.’You might think it unlikely that we would miss the flash of a meteor, but it’s not impossible, as Hill notes: ‘Because of the time required for a sonic shock wave to reach the Earth’s surface from the upper atmosphere, the visible trace of the meteor has usually vanished before its sonic boom is heard.’Is that what we’re hearing in the video above — a distant earthquake or a passing meteor? Although some of the sounds captured in the video may have natural explanations, some of the other noises clearly originated from a common, artificial source: an iPhone.At the 4:45 mark in the above-displayed video, a clip purportedly taken in Alberta, Canada, begins to play and (like all of the other clips in this video) features a strange and seemingly unexplainable noise. But this section of the video is unique in having a definitive explanation: YouTube user DangleSnipeCelly08 admitted that the clip she uploaded on 14 January 2012 was a hoax:admittedI made the video by taking out my iPhone and merely video recorded my balcony view while holding my laptop right behind it, while my laptop played (another video featuring strange sounds) in the background. Took less than a minute to do this.I made it because I was surprised at the attention (these videos were) getting, and the friends on my Facebook friends list were voicing their fear, which I think is wrong. I easily found that the Conklin video and I believe the Ukraine video has the exact same audio on them (hello Tropical birds in Conklin), so I decided that I had to share my knowledge. I made the video to show my friends and family how easy it was (literally less than five minutes of my life to make the video and upload it) to make something like that, and how they shouldn’t believe everything they see online, and should especially not get fearful.I made the video by taking out my iPhone and merely video recorded my balcony view while holding my laptop right behind it, while my laptop played (another video featuring strange sounds) in the background.

Although it’s possible that a recurring natural phenomenon has been captured in various locations around the world, it is more plausible that a single audio stream was duplicated and embedded into multiple video clips.Latin PostStill, the original noise had to come from somewhere. So is this noise natural, or supernatural? The most likely answer is that the sound came from Hollywood:Even if the majority of clips in the video shared by Latin Post do not feature “apocalyptic noises” coming from the sky, the world is not void of unexplainable noises. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) still don’t know where the whistle over the Pacific Ocean originates, researchers are still unsure of what causes a mysterious “humming” noise heard by many people in Britain, and the USGS still hasn’t identified a cause for “skyquakes” booms.Latin Postwhistlehummingskyquakes",[],"[{""id"" : 3524766"",""""begin"": 205,""end"": 212,""entity"": ""YouTube"",""text"": ""YouTube"",""score"": 0.42,""categories"" : [""YouTube"",""2005 establishments in the United States"",""Article Feedback 5 Additional Articles"",""Companies based in San Mateo County, California"",""Companies established in 2005"",""Entertainment websites"",""Google acquisitions"",""Google services"",""Internet companies of the United States"",""Internet properties established in 2005"",""Multilingual websites"",""Video hosting"",""Video on demand services""]},{""id"" : 2681261"",""""begin"": 728,""end"": 733,""entity"": ""Laconic phrase"",""text"": ""it it"",""score"": 0.51,""categories"" : [""Rhetoric""]},{""id"" : 2681261"",""""begin"": 1033,""end"": 1038,""entity"": ""Laconic phrase"",""text"": ""it it"",""score"": 0.51,""categories"" : [""Rhetoric""]},{""id"" : 18582230"",""""begin"": 1294,""end"": 1301,""entity"": ""Methane"",""text"": ""methane"",""score"": 0.46,""categories"" : [""Methane"",""Anaerobic digestion"",""Greenhouse gases"",""Fuels"",""Fuel gas""]},{""id"" : 7674400"",""""begin"": 1461,""end"": 1471,""entity"": ""David Hill (Oregon politician)"",""text"": ""David Hill"",""score"": 0.36,""categories"" : [""People from Hillsboro, Oregon"",""Champoeg Meetings"",""Members of the Provisional Government of Oregon"",""Members of the Oregon Territorial Legislature"",""1809 births"",""1850 deaths"",""Burials at Hillsboro Pioneer Cemetery"",""Oregon pioneers""]},{""id"" : 252000"",""""begin"": 1891,""end"": 1907,""entity"": ""Mammoth Mountain"",""text"": ""Mammoth Mountain"",""score"": 0.37,""categories"" : [""Lava domes"",""Mountains of Madera County, California"",""Mountains of Mono County, California"",""Volcanoes of Madera County, California"",""Volcanoes of Mono County, California"",""Inyo National Forest"",""Mountains of the Sierra Nevada (U.S.)""]},{""id"" : 13681879"",""""begin"": 2184,""end"": 2191,""entity"": ""Living on the Edge (UK TV series)"",""text"": ""judders"",""score"": 0.50,""categories"" : []},{""id"" : 673717"",""""begin"": 2312,""end"": 2322,""entity"": ""David B.

35,,snopes,,"Betsy Ross made the first American flag (or one of the first American flags), known as the """"Betsy Ross flag,"""" and was a Quaker who opposed slavery.",2019-09-27,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/betsy-ross-quaker-slavery-views/,,,,"During her life, Betsy Ross was a craftswoman who made flags. After her death, her name and a historical flag design linked to it took on a life of their own. But much of what is assumed to be true is an emotionally fraught myth.Over time, Betsy Ross became something of a legend whose role in the American Revolutionary War was the creation of the first version of the Stars and Stripes. But in the Trump era, the meaning of the flag associated with her name has shifted, as illustrated by a meme that circulated on Facebook in late September 2019:How did the historical flag dubbed “Betsy Ross,” named after the woman who is often depicted in art work sewing the 13-star design in her parlor at the behest of George Washington, come to represent slavery in the minds of some, as inferred by the meme?art workThe furor started in the summer of 2019, when clothing brand Nike canceled a sneaker design that featured the flag, purportedly after athlete-turned-civil-rights activist Colin Kaepernick and others raised concerns about it. Not only did placing the flag on the Air Max 1 sneaker give the problematic appearance of celebrating an era in American history in which slavery was legal, critics stated, the flag had also been spotted among extremists at the deadly “Unite the Right” white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.purportedlycritics statedThe criticism and Nike’s actions attracted what has become a typical backlash against topics of racial justice in the Trump era: hyperbole that fails to directly address the issue at hand:It’s a good thing @Nike only wants to sell sneakers to people who hate the American flag…. @NFL #HappyFourth https://t.co/G6w8vDjvLP— Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) July 2, 2019It’s a good thing @Nike only wants to sell sneakers to people who hate the American flag…. @NFL #HappyFourth https://t.co/G6w8vDjvLP@Nike@NFL#HappyFourthhttps://t.co/G6w8vDjvLP— Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) July 2, 2019July 2, 2019Since this controversy, many have attempted to defend the Betsy Ross flag with heavy doses of whataboutism or misdirection.whataboutismThe criticism over the shoe design, after all, was not about Betsy Ross herself. It instead questioned a popular brand for appearing to celebrate an American era in which black people were enslaved, and raised concerns over the the evolution of that flag’s meaning, post-Charlottesville.The facts about Ross, the historical person, differ greatly from the myth. Although she was born into a Quaker family and the Quakers were opposed to slavery, her personal views on the subject are unknown because no historical documentation from her point of view (letters, journals, or other records) is known to survive. That’s largely because Ross was not famous until well after her death, according Marla R. Miller, professor of history at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and author of the book “Betsy Ross and the Making of America.”“There is no document that answers the specific question” about her views on slavery, Miller told us by phone. “We do know that she was a member of the Quaker community, raised in the Quaker tradition, and that in these decades, the Quaker community increasingly rejected slavery.”Only slight evidence exists that documents Ross’ work making flags during the War of Independence. She was a craftswoman in the upholstery trades. She did make numerous flags for the federal government alongside her daughter, Clarissa Wilson, particularly in the years before the War of 1812. The design of the American flag evolved over the course of the Revolutionary era, and no evidence exists that any of the flags she made bore the 13 stars-in-a-circle pattern.Ross did know George Washington — he patronized her upholstery business. Early documentation of her story given by her daughter asserts that Ross was proud of introducing Washington to a method of folding that allowed five-point stars to be created with just one cut of the scissors, making production quicker and easier. But Ross’ story, as relayed by her daughter, does not include the claim that she made the first American flag.patronizedRoss was indeed raised in the Quaker tradition, although she was forced out of the faith when she married John Ross, an Anglican. She was widowed and remarried twice, returning to the Quaker tradition later in life with the formation of the Free Quakers after the Revolutionary War.AnglicanThere’s a reason for that lack of historical clarity around the origins of the flag, said Marc Leepson, historian and author of the book “Flag: An American Biography.” During Ross’ lifetime, flags weren’t endowed with the type of sanctity characteristic of current norms — so the making of flags wasn’t considered noteworthy.bookFurthermore, an official flag design didn’t exist until President William Howard Taft signed an order designating one in 1912. Popular images depicting Washington crossing the Delaware with the Betsy Ross flag, for instance, are apocryphal. The oldest physical flag with that configuration of stars found to date was made in the early 1800s.1912images“We don’t know who made the first American flag,” Leepson told us. “It wouldn’t have been newsworthy that someone made the first flag, because people didn’t feel even remotely the same way about it like they do now.”Adulation of the flag, in the way that it is done now, started in the North at the commencement of the American Civil War, Leepson said. After the war, it spread nationwide. The symbol of a nation united after a bloody civil war was part of the flag’s newfound importance, Leepson noted.Miller theorizes that the story of Ross and the first American flag took off because the time period her descendants were going public with it coincided with the women’s suffrage movement. It solved a cultural problem by giving a woman an important place in the Revolutionary War while doing something domestic and non-threatening, which was sewing. It was solidified in the popular imagination with a public campaign to preserve her historic Philadelphia home on Arch Street.No known documentation of Betsy Ross’ personally held beliefs about slavery exist, but because she was a member of the Quaker community for a significant portion of her life, it’s probably a credible assumption that she herself opposed it. However, the origins of the so-called Betsy Ross flag are apocryphal, which arguably renders her beliefs in relation to that flag’s use irrelevant. Furthermore, the more recent argument against the use of the flag for mainstream purposes stems from a new evolution of the flag’s use by far-right groups at a racist rally in 2017.",[],"[{""id"" :

36,,snopes,,The Democratic party has tried to impeach every Republican president since Dwight D. Eisenhower.,2019-09-27,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dems-impeach-gop-presidents/,,,,"A popular rumor floating around social media posits that Democrats have attempted to impeach every Republican president since Dwight D. Eisenhower:This claim is both factually inaccurate and misleading.The U.S. has had six republican presidents since Eisenhower left office in 1961: Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump. The claim is wrong on its face because Democrats made no effort to impeach Ford. While a handful of Democratic lawmakers have introduced articles of impeachment against five of the last six Republican presidents, in most cases these efforts weren’t taken seriously by the party at large. Nixon and Trump have been the only Republican presidents since Ike who have faced a serious threat of impeachment.Multiple ways exist to start the impeachment process. Typically, it begins when a member of the House of Representatives introduces articles of impeachment. From there, the matter is typically referred to a committee where an inquiry can be opened. If the committee finds that the evidence warrants impeachment, they can send the matter to the full House for a vote. If the House votes to impeach, the case gets sent to the Senate, where an impeachment hearing is held. If two-thirds of the senators vote to convict, the president is removed from office.   Multiple waysHere’s a simplified version of this process:simplifiedRepresentative introduces articles of impeachment.Committee investigates matter and votes to send articles to full House.House votes to impeach and sends the case to the Senate.Senate votes to convict and the president is removed from office. Representative introduces articles of impeachment.Committee investigates matter and votes to send articles to full House.House votes to impeach and sends the case to the Senate.Senate votes to convict and the president is removed from office. The impeachment efforts against Reagan, Bush Jr., and Bush Sr. only reached the first step of this process. These efforts didn’t receive much support from the Democratic party as a whole, and they never made their way out of committee for a vote in front of the full House. When Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, introduced articles of impeachment against Reagan in 1987, the Associated Press reported that the effort had “virtually no chance of being approved”:Associated PressArticles of impeachment charging President Reagan with misconduct in office because of his actions in the Iran-Contra affair were introduced in the House on Thursday by a Texas Democrat. But they were given virtually no chance of being approved …… The articles were not expected to be approved and were not presented in a forum to be taken seriously by the House leadership.Gonzalez made his remarks at a time in which the House had concluded its official business for the day and a handful of members were making speeches. Less than a half dozen members were on the floor at the time.Articles of impeachment charging President Reagan with misconduct in office because of his actions in the Iran-Contra affair were introduced in the House on Thursday by a Texas Democrat. But they were given virtually no chance of being approved …… The articles were not expected to be approved and were not presented in a forum to be taken seriously by the House leadership.Gonzalez made his remarks at a time in which the House had concluded its official business for the day and a handful of members were making speeches. Less than a half dozen members were on the floor at the time.Gonzalez also filed articles of impeachment against Bush Sr., first in 1991, when H.R. 34 was referred to House Judiciary Committee, and then again in 1992, when H.R. 86 was put before the Subcommittee on Economic and Commercial Law. Neither of these efforts received a vote. 19911992,The impeachment effort against Bush Jr. was a bit more serious. Congressmen Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, and Robert Wexler, D-Fla., introduced 35 articles of impeachment against Bush to the U.S. House of Representatives in June 2008. Twenty-four Republicans joined 227 Democrats to vote in favor of sending the resolution to the House Committee on the Judiciary. Bush would leave office a few months later, however, before any other action was taken on the matter. voteWhile articles of impeachment were introduced against Reagan and Bush Sr., these efforts never received the backing of the Democratic Party, never made it past committee, and were never brought to the House for a vote. A bit more support existed behind the impeachment efforts against Bush Jr., but again, this matter was not referred to the House for a full vote. The only Republican president since Eisenhower (and before Donald Trump) who faced a serious threat of impeachment was Nixon. Nixon made it to step 2 of the impeachment process in July 1974 when the Judiciary Committee voted to send articles of impeachment to the House for a vote. This was a bipartisan effort, however, as six of the 17 Republicans on the Judiciary Committee joined their 21 Democrat colleagues to vote in favor of the resolution. votedNixon would have faced a vote in front of the full House, but he resigned from office before the vote took place.facedAs of this writing, Trump is in the middle of step 2 of the impeachment process. U. S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced an official impeachment inquiry into the president, but the matter has not yet been referred to House of Representatives for an official impeachment vote. To sum up: This meme claims that Democrats have tried to impeach every Republican president since Eisenhower. As no impeachment efforts were made against Gerald Ford, this claim is false. It is true, however, that articles of impeachment were filed against five of the last six Republican presidents. In two of those cases (Reagan and Bush Sr.), these efforts were led by a handful of politicians and did not receive support from the Democratic party as a whole. It should also be noted that the most serious impeachment effort, that against Nixon, received bipartisan support. every",[],"[{""id"" : 32070"",""""begin"": 99,""end"": 109,""entity"": ""Republican Party (United States)"",""text"": ""Republican"",""score"": 0.38,""categories"" : [""Republican Party (United States)"",""International Democrat Union member parties"",""Political parties established in 1854"",""Political parties in the United States"",""Article Feedback 5 Additional Articles""]},{""id"" : 8182"",""""begin"": 126,""end"": 145,""entity"": ""Dwight D.

37,,snopes,,"A viral social media post about the outcome of impeaching U. S. President Donald Trump was accurate and was written by """"Hyram F. Suddfluffel.""""",2019-09-27,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hyram-suddfluffel-impeachment/,,,,"In September 2019, we received a wave of inquiries regarding the authenticity and provenance of a viral message that was re-shared in the aftermath of congressional Democrats’ announcement that they intended to open impeachment hearings against U.S. President Donald Trump. The typical version of the message purported to have been written by one “Hyram F. Suddfluffel, PhD” and typically began: “By Hyram F. Suddfluffel, PhD, (Political Science).I have a degree in Political Science, and I am a card-carrying Libertarian. I’ve been studying politics and political history for the past 30 years. My specialty is U.S. Presidents. That said, I hope that the House of Representatives impeaches Trump. Let me tell you what will happen next!”The post went on to outline several purported stages in the impeachment process, claiming that the Republican-controlled Senate would vote against convicting Trump, and that the process would ultimately backfire on the Democrats, because once impeachment begins, lawyers for the president would be able to “subpoena and question anyone they want.”As a result, according to the viral message, Republicans would interrogate several high-profile political or intelligence community figures who have either criticized or opposed Trump or played a role in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigations, thus revealing their supposed guilt in unspecified crimes — “James Comey, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, Bruce Ohr, Glenn Simpson, Donna Brazille, Eric Holder, Loretta Lynch, Christopher Steele, Hillary Clinton, John Brennan, James Clapper, and a whole host of other participants in this whole sordid affair …”It’s not clear where the post first originated, who wrote it, and whether “Hyram F. Suddfluffel” even exists or has a doctorate in political science. We discovered multiple versions of the “impeachment backfire” text, the earliest being in a June 3 post on the right-leaning political forum Free Republic. There, a user with the handle “lonster” outlined the theory, saying it had been “passed on by an old friend”:postThe earliest version we found on Facebook was posted on June 11 by a user going by the name “John Tunis.” That version did not attribute the message to any named person and did not include any mention of academic credentials: During June and July, versions of the text were shared widely on Facebook and, based on the submissions from Snopes readers, via chain emails. Twitter users began sharing it in August.sharingIn some versions, no author is named. In others, especially those submitted by Snopes readers in September, the author is claimed to be “Hyram F. Suddfluffel, PhD.” In still others, the author is given as “Gary Knoepke.” no authorclaimedothersNo evidence exists that clearly establishes the identity of the person who first came up with the “impeachment backfire” text. We found no evidence to show that it was a “Gary Knoepke,” and no evidence to show that anyone by the name “Hyram F. Suddfluffel” even exists, with or without a doctorate in political science.‘What will happen next’‘What will happen next’Many of the factual claims made in the text itself were accurate, though the post may have overstated the case for a dramatic counterattack by Trump’s lawyers against his perceived foes. The post was correct in saying that, if the House of Representatives passes articles of impeachment against the president (a likely outcome, because the Democrats currently have the majority required to do this), then the Senate would hold something akin to a criminal trial against Trump. requiredThe next claim is a prediction, though it is a perfectly plausible one: “There will be a vote, and the Republicans will vote unanimously, along with a small number of Democrats, to not convict the President. Legally, it will all be over at that point.”Though no one can say what might happen in an impeachment against Trump, it is the case that Republicans currently have a majority in the Senate, and a two-thirds majority vote is needed to remove a president from office. Given those stark numbers, it would appear that Senate Republicans would require relatively strong evidence of relatively serious wrongdoing on the part of the president in order to “cross the floor” and vote to remove him from office. neededThe post’s claim that Trump “has zero chance of conviction” in the Senate is an exaggeration, and there is historical precedent for members of Congress turning on a president of their own party during impeachment, as we outlined in an earlier article:article“In 1974, faced with increasingly damning evidence of obstruction of justice, six out of 17 Republicans sitting on the committee supported the impeachment of Republican President Richard Nixon. The Democrats already had a majority on the committee at that time, so they didn’t need those Republican votes. But with them came a resounding majority of 27 to 11.”six‘Subpoena and question anyone they want’‘Subpoena and question anyone they want’Perhaps the most important claim made in the post, and the one that has arguably caused it to be gleefully shared by supporters of the president, is that which relates to the ability of Trump’s lawyers to subpoena and interrogate some of their client’s perceived foes: “The President’s attorneys will have the right to subpoena and question anyone they want.”It is true that the defendant in a Senate impeachment trial can issue subpoenas. A document called the “Rules of Procedure and Practice in the Senate When Sitting on Impeachment Trials” includes a formula of words for subpoenas in such trials, specifying that the subpoena can be issued on behalf of “the party impeached, or of his counsel”:document“Form of a subpoena be issued on the application of the managers of the impeachment, or of the party impeached, or of his counsel.”Despite this ability to issue subpoenas, it is not at all clear that the president’s legal team would be able to subpoena evidence or testimony from “anyone they want,” or at least, they likely wouldn’t be able to coerce the compliance of any and every target of their ire. It’s not specified in the Senate impeachment “Rules of Procedure,” but the rules of federal criminal procedure state that anyone issued a subpoena as part of a criminal trial (on which Congressional impeachment is loosely modeled) can apply to the court to have the subpoena quashed. They can do this on several grounds, including on the basis that the subpoena is “unreasonable or oppressive.” Multiple federal court precedents have held that the evidence and testimony requested under subpoena, in criminal trials, must be relevant to the case at hand, and cannot amount to a “fishing expedition.” basiscourtprecedentsrelevantThough it’s not clear whether this jurisprudence would carry over into a Senate impeachment trial, it would be reasonable to imagine that the same principles apply. If that is the case, then the president’s lawyers could not simply force a third party (such as Hillary Clinton, James Comey, Eric Holder, or any of the other figures mentioned in the post) to provide any and all evidence requested, or answer any and every question put to them.The evidence requested, and the testimony desired, would likely have to be relevant to Trump’s defense against the specific allegations against him, under the article(s) of impeachment. However, since the rules governing impeachment proceedings are not the same as those that govern criminal trials, we can’t say definitively what the president’s lawyers might be allowed to do.",[],"[{""id"" : 12692359"",""""begin"": 97,""end"": 110,""entity"": ""Viral message"",""text"": ""viral message"",""score"": 0.52,""categories"" : []},{""id"" : 24113"",""""begin"": 242,""end"": 254,""entity"": ""President of the United States"",""text"": ""U.S. President"",""score"": 0.31,""categories"" : [""Presidents of the United States"",""Presidency of the United States""]},{""id"" : 4848272"",""""begin"": 255,""end"": 267,""entity"": ""Donald Trump"",""text"": ""Donald Trump"",""score"": 0.66,""categories"" : [""Living people"",""1946 births"",""20th-century American businesspeople"",""20th-century American writers"",""21st-century American businesspeople"",""21st-century American writers"",""American billionaires"",""American business writers"",""American casino industry businesspeople"",""American chief executives"",""American construction businesspeople"",""American cosmetics businesspeople"",""American education businesspeople"",""American fashion businesspeople"",""American game show hosts"",""American people of German descent"",""American people of Scottish descent"",""American Presbyterians"",""American real estate businesspeople"",""American reality television producers"",""American restaurateurs"",""American socialites"",""Businesspeople from Florida"",""Businesspeople from New York City"",""Businesspeople in the beverage industry"",""Conspiracy theorists"",""Fordham University alumni"",""New York Military Academy alumni"",""New York Republicans"",""Participants in American reality television series"",""People from Manhattan"",""People from Palm Beach, Florida"",""People from Queens"",""Television producers from New York"",""Trump family"",""United States Football League executives"",""Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania alumni"",""Writers from Florida"",""Writers from New York City"",""Article Feedback 5 Additional Articles""]},{""id"" : 3225498"",""""begin"": 491,""end"": 502,""entity"": ""Libertarianism"",""text"": ""Libertarian"",""score"": 0.38,""categories"" : [""Libertarianism by form"",""Articles with inconsistent citation formats"",""Libertarianism"",""History of economic thought"",""Economic ideologies"",""Political philosophy"",""Philosophical movements""]},{""id"" : 223929"",""""begin"": 1011,""end"": 1019,""entity"": ""Subpoena"",""text"": ""subpoena"",""score"": 0.40,""categories"" : [""Latin legal terms"",""Legal documents""]},{""id"" : 12692359"",""""begin"": 1079,""end"": 1092,""entity"": ""Viral message"",""text"": ""viral message"",""score"": 0.52,""categories"" : []},{""id"" : 471457"",""""begin"": 1267,""end"": 1281,""entity"": ""Robert Mueller"",""text"": ""Robert Mueller"",""score"": 0.68,""categories"" : [""1944 births"",""American military personnel of the Vietnam War"",""Directors of the FBI"",""Living people"",""New York University alumni"",""People from Pennsylvania"",""Princeton University alumni"",""Recipients of the Bronze Star Medal"",""Recipients of the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal"",""Recipients of the Purple Heart medal"",""St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire) alumni"",""United States Assistant Attorneys General"",""United States Attorneys for the Northern District of California"",""United States Marine Corps officers"",""University of Virginia School of Law alumni""]},{""id"" : 2156690"",""""begin"": 1357,""end"": 1368,""entity"": ""James Comey"",""text"": ""James Comey"",""score"": 0.72,""categories"" : []},{""id"" : 55958278"",""""begin"": 1369,""end"": 1381,""entity"": ""Peter Strzok"",""text"": ""Peter Strzok"",""score"": 0.60,""categories"" : []},{""id"" : 56486659"",""""begin"": 1392,""end"": 1401,""entity"": ""Bruce Ohr"",""text"": ""Bruce Ohr"",""score"": 0.66,""categories"" : []},{""id"" : 52843862"",""""begin"": 1402,""end"": 1415,""entity"": ""Glenn R.

In response, the president’s defenders have highlighted a May 4, 2018, letter signed by three Democratic senators to Yuriy Lutsenko, the prosecutor general of Ukraine (a similar role to the U.S. attorney general), as evidence that claims of improper behavior are misplaced. The letter was notably described by Washington Post columnist Marc Theisen as betraying a “double standard.”havehighlightedletternotablydescribedThis sentiment was amplified by several media outlets, as well as a viral tweet (retweeted by Donald Trump Jr.) from the Twitter account Comfortably Smug, which according to BuzzFeed News is run by a “Republican political consultant and deliberate spreader of false information”:retweetedrun byFactual ProblemsSeveral reasons exist why the above tweet and associated sentiment are incorrect and misleading. At the top of that list is the fact that the letter in question did not concern a request to “investigate Trump,” nor did it request the opening of any investigation.letterInstead, it requested information on why Ukrainian special prosecutor Serhiy Horbatyuk (who serves in a special prosecutor role charged with investigating corruption cases linked to former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich) had been “prohibited” from “issuing subpoenas for evidence or interviewing witnesses” in four existing investigations into former Trump Campaign Manager Paul Manafort. Manafort, prior to joining the Trump campaign, had worked as a political consultant for Yanukovich and his political party. The four investigations involved money that flowed either to Manafort for this consulting work or to a law firm working with Manafort and others to improve Yanukovich’s image in the West. They did not involve Trump.consultantlaw firmThe three Democratic senators — then-Foreign Affairs Committee members Robert Menendez, Dick Durbin, and Patrick Leahy — were responding to a May 2, 2018, New York Times report that the four Manafort investigations in Ukraine were specifically singled out from a docket of nearly 3,000 corruption cases in Horbatyuk’s portfolio to be blocked from issuing subpoenas and interviewing witnesses. U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, in his charge to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, was investigating Manafort in part because of concerns that he owed substantial funds to Russian oligarchs as a result of this consulting work, potentially giving them leverage over him as he ran Trump’s campaign. The reason Ukrainian officials impeded the investigation was no secret, according to the Times — it was to placate the Trump administration, which opposed the Mueller probe:reportas a resultaccordingVolodymyr Ariev, a member of Parliament who is an ally of [now former] President Petro O. Poroshenko, readily acknowledged that the intention in Kiev was to put investigations into Mr. Manafort’s activities “in the long-term box.”“In every possible way, we will avoid irritating the top American officials,” Mr. Ariev said in an interview. “We shouldn’t spoil relations with the administration.”Volodymyr Ariev, a member of Parliament who is an ally of [now former] President Petro O. Poroshenko, readily acknowledged that the intention in Kiev was to put investigations into Mr. Manafort’s activities “in the long-term box.”“In every possible way, we will avoid irritating the top American officials,” Mr. Ariev said in an interview. “We shouldn’t spoil relations with the administration.”These discussions came at a complicated time for Ukraine, a country that has been fighting Russian aggression and that had been in the process of securing arms from the United States. “The decision to halt the investigations by an anti-corruption prosecutor was handed down as the Trump administration was finalizing plans to sell the country sophisticated anti-tank missiles, called Javelins,” the Times reported.reportedFar from requesting an “investigation”, the senators requested answers to three specific questions from a specific Ukrainian government official:specific questionsHas your office taken any steps to restrict cooperation with the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller? If so, why?Did any individual from the Trump Administration, or anyone acting on its behalf, encourage Ukrainian government or law enforcement officials not to cooperate with the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller?Was the Mueller probe raised in any way during discussions between your government and U.S. officials, including around the meeting of Presidents Trump and Poroshenko in New York in 2017?Has your office taken any steps to restrict cooperation with the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller? If so, why?Did any individual from the Trump Administration, or anyone acting on its behalf, encourage Ukrainian government or law enforcement officials not to cooperate with the investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller?Was the Mueller probe raised in any way during discussions between your government and U.S. officials, including around the meeting of Presidents Trump and Poroshenko in New York in 2017?Manafort broadly admitted to involvement in activities related to those four Ukrainian probes via a September 2018 guilty plea.admittedA Flawed ComparisonEven ignoring the allegedly implied quid pro quo in the Trump-Zelensky call, a comparison between the senators’ request for information from the chief Ukrainian law enforcement official and Trump’s requests of Zelensky is problematic.As senators on the Committee on Foreign Relations, which not only provides oversight for arms deals but also general oversight of America’s relationships with its allies, Menendez, Durbin, and Leahy were acting within their constitutional rights and obligations as official representatives of the U.S. government with oversight responsibility over the executive branch.for arms dealsconstitutional rightsConversely, in his July 25 phone call with Zelensky, Trump explicitly requested that the Ukrainian president meet with his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani — an unelected private citizen without a security clearance or oversight from anyone but Trump — to initiate investigations into a disparate set of claims whose sole unifying feature is that they concern Trump’s political rivals: the Democratic National Committee and the Biden family.disparate set of claimsBecause the letter at issue did not actually demand an investigation into Trump or even compel initiation of any investigation, we rank the claim that Democrats asked Ukraine to “investigate Trump” in 2018 as false.",[],"[{""id"" : 24113"",""""begin"": 44,""end"": 56,""entity"": ""President of

39,,snopes,,Muslims in Switzerland burned a Swiss flag and demanded the cross be removed from it.,2019-09-26,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/muslims-cross-swiss-flag/,,,,"In late September 2019, the anti-Muslim hate site Frontlines News published a bogus story reporting that “Muslims in Switzerland are demanding that the white cross be removed from the Swiss national flag because as a Christian symbol it ‘no longer corresponds to today’s multicultural Switzerland.'”bogus storyThe story contains a thumbnail image of men holding up a flag and burning it.The image was not taken recently and it wasn’t taken in Switzerland — in fact, the flag being burned is Danish, not Swiss. The photograph in question was taken by Agence France-Presse photographer Rizwan Tabassum in February 2006 in Karachi, Pakistan. According to the picture’s caption, it depicts men burning a flag in response to outrage over cartoons in European newspapers depicting the Prophet Muhammad, the central figure of Islam. Generally, depicting Muhammad in images and statues is forbidden for observant Muslims.photographforbiddenFrontlines News quotes and links to a story that was originally published by the Gatestone Institute, an anti-Muslim, non-profit organization that, as NBC News reported in April 2018, “promoted misleading and false anti-Muslim news, some of which was amplified by a Russian troll factory” in the lead-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential elections.Gatestone InstitutereportedThe Gatestone story cited by Frontlines News quotes only one source, Ivica Petrusic, who was the vice president of the Swiss social justice advocacy group Second@s Plus. Petrusic was quoted saying the cross should be removed from the flag to reflect a separation between church and state and the country’s growing cultural diversity.Petrusic makes no mention of Muslim people making that demand. The only element of the story linking to Muslims is Gateway’s unfounded assertion that Second@s “represents mostly Muslim second-generation foreigners in Switzerland.”Because the image took place at a different time and in a different place than Frontlines News reported, and because the underlying story originated in 2011 from an already-unreliable source, we rate this claim “False.",[],"[{""id"" :

40,,snopes,,"The show """"The Simpsons"""" predicted the common autocorrect feature on phones, tablets and computers.",2019-09-26,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/simpsons-predict-autocorrect/,,,,"On Nov. 13, 1994, an episode of “The Simpsons” entitled “Lisa on Ice” aired on the Fox television network that featured a visual gag of text on a mobile device’s screen changing from “Beat Up Martin” to “Eat Up Martha.” This led many to claim that “The Simpsons” had “predicted” autocorrect.Former NFL player and radio host Pat McAfee, for instance, outlined this claim in a popular episode of the “Pat McAfee Show”:“Auto correct errors. 1994. Before you could even play snake on the grey little box phone, they predicted that auto correct would happen … Didn’t happen until 2007.”“Auto correct errors. 1994. Before you could even play snake on the grey little box phone, they predicted that auto correct would happen … Didn’t happen until 2007.”It would be pretty amazing if “The Simpsons” truly predicted the invention of autocorrect. However, that didn’t happen.When “Lisa on Ice” first aired in November 1994, autocorrect was already a feature available in Microsoft Word. According to The New York Times, Microsoft was advertising the feature as early as October 1993, more than a year before “Lisa on Ice” aired:The New York Times“How fast will new Word 6.0 fix typos? How fast can you make them?” asked an advertisement in a computer magazine from October 1993. The newest version of Microsoft’s word processor came with a brand-new feature called AutoCorrect. Type in “SHip teh cartons friday,” and the program would correct your text to “Ship the cartons Friday.”“How fast will new Word 6.0 fix typos? How fast can you make them?” asked an advertisement in a computer magazine from October 1993. The newest version of Microsoft’s word processor came with a brand-new feature called AutoCorrect. Type in “SHip teh cartons friday,” and the program would correct your text to “Ship the cartons Friday.”While autocorrect existed prior to this episode of “The Simpsons” (severely handicapping the show’s ability to predict it), the joke in “Lisa on Ice” is actually commenting on another technological innovation: handwriting recognition. The Apple Newton was one of the first personal digital assistants (PDAs), which hit the market in 1993. While it was an innovative product for its time, it also had problems. The device’s handwriting-recognition software, for instance, wasn’t great at recognizing handwritten words. This led to critiques in the media (a 1993 article in the San Francisco Examiner was titled “Highly Hyped Newton Weak on Handwriting”) and jokes on popular shows such as “The Simpsons.” articleIn fact, school bully Kearney specifically mentions the “Newton Tablet” in the clip from “Lisa on Ice” used to further this “prediction” claim:“The Simpsons” didn’t predict autocorrect. However, this joke did have an impact on the autocorrect feature that would eventually find its way onto the first iPhone. impactCNET reported:reportedApple’s software engineers were so haunted by a gag in The Simpsons they spent years trying to nail the keyboard in the iPhone.As part of an ‘oral history’ — essentially a lot of interviews sewn together — about the Californian company, Fast Company interviewed dozens of former Apple execs. One particularly juicy tidbit it’s just revealed is that software engineers working on the iPhone were traumatised by the Simpsons making fun of the ancient Newton tablet’s handwriting recognition in 1995 ……”In the hallways [at Apple] and while we were talking about the keyboard, you would always hear the words ‘Eat Up Martha’,” says Nitin Ganatra, formerly Apple’s director of engineering for iOS. “We needed to nail the keyboard. We needed to make sure the text input works on this thing, otherwise, ‘Here comes the Eat Up Marthas.'”Apple’s software engineers were so haunted by a gag in The Simpsons they spent years trying to nail the keyboard in the iPhone.As part of an ‘oral history’ — essentially a lot of interviews sewn together — about the Californian company, Fast Company interviewed dozens of former Apple execs.

The visual gag in the 1994 episode “Lisa On Ice” featuring the words “Beat Up Martin” changing to “Eat Up Martha” on a mobile device was actually mocking the problematic handwriting recognition software on the Apple Newton PDA. Autocorrect Prediction Summary: “The Simpsons” supposedly predicted the “autocorrect” feature in a 1994 episode. This feature wasn’t invented until 2007. Referenced Episode: Nov. 13, 1994. Season 6; Episode 8.  “Lisa On Ice.”Facts: Autocorrect has been around since at least 1993. The 2007 date likely refers to the release of the first iPhone. “The Simpsons” was actually commenting on Apple Newton Tablet’s well-known problems with handwriting-recognition software. Autocorrect Prediction SummaryReferenced EpisodeFactsYou can read more about “The Simpsons” alleged predictions in the Snopes’ collection “The Simpsons Didn’t Predict That.”The Simpsons Didn’t Predict That",[],"[{""id"" : 2339110"",""""begin"": 3,""end"": 14,""entity"": ""1994 NFL season"",""text"": ""Nov. 13, 1994"",""score"": 0.54,""categories"" : [""National Football League seasons"",""1994 National Football League season"",""1994 in American football""]},{""id"" : 29838"",""""begin"": 33,""end"": 41,""entity"": ""The Simpsons"",""text"": ""Simpsons"",""score"": 0.66,""categories"" : [""Fox network shows"",""Fox animation"",""1980s American animated television series"",""1980s American television series"",""1989 American television series debuts"",""1990s American animated television series"",""1990s American television series"",""2000s American animated television series"",""2000s American television series"",""2010s American animated television series"",""2010s American television series"",""American animated television series"",""American culture"",""American television sitcoms"",""American comedy television series"",""Animated sitcoms"",""English-language television series"",""Peabody Award winning television programs"",""Satirical television programmes"",""Television programs featuring anthropomorphic characters"",""Television series about dysfunctional families"",""Television series by Fox Television Studios"",""Television series by Gracie Films"",""Television shows set in the United States"",""Television spin-offs"",""The Simpsons"",""Television series created by Matt Groening""]},{""id"" : 1624784"",""""begin"": 51,""end"": 62,""entity"": ""Lisa on Ice"",""text"": ""Lisa on Ice"",""score"": 0.57,""categories"" : [""The Simpsons (season 6) episodes"",""1994 television episodes""]},{""id"" : 23669161"",""""begin"": 72,""end"": 79,""entity"": ""T.H.E.

41,,snopes,,Musician Jimi Hendrix faked his death and is now living as actor Morgan Freeman.,2019-09-26,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/morgan-freeman-jimi-hendrix/,,,,"A bizarre conspiracy theory holding that U.S. musician Jimi Hendrix faked his death in 1970 and is now living as renown actor Morgan Freeman is frequently shared on social media. For instance, Newspunch, a website that has repeatedly trafficked in this sort of misinformation, published an article entitled “Morgan Freeman is Jimi Hendrix, Researchers Claim” in May 2018, stating:Newspunchrepeatedly traffickedMorgan Freeman is Jimi Hendrix, Researchers ClaimJimi Hendrix reinvented himself as actor Morgan Freeman in the 1970’s, shortly after faking his own death, researchers claim.According to internet sleuths, Morgan Freeman’s sudden rise to fame in the 1970’s occurred after Hendrix supposedly died on September 18, 1970.Jimi Hendrix reinvented himself as actor Morgan Freeman in the 1970’s, shortly after faking his own death, researchers claim.According to internet sleuths, Morgan Freeman’s sudden rise to fame in the 1970’s occurred after Hendrix supposedly died on September 18, 1970.Newspunch later updated the intro and title of this article to make it clear that this rumor originated with conspiracy theorists and not “researchers”: updatedWe have updated the headline and opening of the article to make it clear that while the theory that Jimi Hendrix and Morgan Freeman are the same person is entertaining, it is extremely unlikely to be true.We have updated the headline and opening of the article to make it clear that while the theory that Jimi Hendrix and Morgan Freeman are the same person is entertaining, it is extremely unlikely to be true.The idea that Freeman is actually Hendrix is largely based on three claims: Freeman and Hendrix are both fans of music; Freeman and Hendrix look alike; and Freeman’s acting career didn’t take off until after Hendrix’ death in 1970.While the first two claims may be accurate, they are also not especially convincing. After all, Freeman and Hendrix are far from the only people who enjoy music. Freeman does own a blues bar in Mississippi, but if liking blues music is the threshold for evidence, it’s equally likely that Freeman is actually Robert Johnson, Howlin’ Wolf, Freddie King, Little Walter, Big Bill Broonzy, Mississippi John Hurt, T-Bone Walker, or any other famous, deceased blues musician.blues bar in MississippiFreeman’s appreciation for blues music probably speaks more to his upbringing in Memphis, Tennessee, and Chicago, Illinois, than it does to the claim that Freeman is actually a deceased musician. Freeman and Hendrix also do bare a passing resemblance to one another:However, many of the image comparisons accompanying this rumor border on parody. The website WellAware1, for instance, attempted to draw a definitive link between Freeman and Hendrix based on the wrinkles seen in two photographs taken decades apart:WellAware1Scribbling lines onto a photograph does not constitute evidence.The final claim, holding that Freeman’s career didn’t begin until after Hendrix’s death, is inaccurate. Hendrix died on Sept. 18, 1970. A post-mortem examination found that Hendrix died of “suffocation due to barbiturate intoxication.” A newspaper clipping on Hendrix’ death can be found below: Tue, Sep 29, 1970 – 78 · Chicago Tribune (Chicago, Illinois) · Newspapers.com Tue, Sep 29, 1970 – 78 · Chicago Tribune (Chicago, Illinois) · Newspapers.com Tue, Sep 29, 1970 – 78 · Chicago Tribune (Chicago, Illinois) · Newspapers.comChicago Tribune (Chicago, Illinois)While Freeman was not a household name at the time of Hendrix’s death, his acting career began prior to 1970. Morgan’s first onscreen appearance came in 1964 in a non-credited role in the Sidney Lumet movie “The Pawnbroker.” Freeman also appeared in at least four stage productions, including “Hello, Dolly!,” “The Dozen,” and “Exhibition,” prior to Hendrix’s death. Here’s a newspaper clipping from 1969 featuring an unflattering review of “The Dozens” published in The Herald-News:first onscreen appearance Fri, Mar 14, 1969 – 50 · The Herald-News (Passaic, New Jersey) · Newspapers.com Fri, Mar 14, 1969 – 50 · The Herald-News (Passaic, New Jersey) · Newspapers.com Fri, Mar 14, 1969 – 50 · The Herald-News (Passaic, New Jersey) · Newspapers.comThe Herald-News (Passaic, New Jersey)It seems a bit implausible that Hendrix was moonlighting as an actor at the same time he was performing as a musician just so that he could fake his death and pursue a career in the movies.",[],"[{""id"" : 16095"",""""begin"": 53,""end"": 65,""entity"": ""Jimi Hendrix"",""text"": ""Jimi Hendrix"",""score"": 0.58,""categories"" : [""Jimi Hendrix"",""1942 births"",""1970 deaths"",""African-American people"",""Alcohol-related deaths in England"",""American baritones"",""American expatriates in the United Kingdom"",""American funk guitarists"",""American people of Irish descent"",""American people of Canadian descent"",""American people of Cherokee descent"",""American record producers"",""American rock guitarists"",""Band of Gypsys members"",""Drug-related deaths in England"",""Garfield High School (Seattle, Washington) alumni"",""Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award winners"",""Lead guitarists"",""Musicians from Seattle, Washington"",""People from Renton, Washington"",""Psychedelic rock musicians"",""Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees"",""The Jimi Hendrix Experience members"",""United States Army soldiers""]},{""id"" : 20584"",""""begin"": 124,""end"": 138,""entity"": ""Morgan Freeman"",""text"": ""Morgan Freeman"",""score"": 0.57,""categories"" : [""1937 births"",""Living people"",""20th-century American actors"",""21st-century American actors"",""American people of Nigerien descent"",""American people of Songhai descent"",""American people of Tuareg descent"",""Actors from Indiana"",""Actors from Mississippi"",""Actors from Tennessee"",""African-American film actors"",""African-American film directors"",""African-American television actors"",""American aviators"",""American film directors"",""American stage actors"",""Best Actor Empire Award winners"",""Best Musical or Comedy Actor Golden Globe (film) winners"",""Best Supporting Actor Academy Award winners"",""Cecil B.

The advent of GPS technology, however, has led to the development of devices that enable the reliable tracking of a vehicle’s location, speed, and direction of travel from virtually anywhere on the globe.trackingSince such tracking devices are no longer solely the province of spy films and literature, it’s not so far-fetched that some people might be concerned whether any such gadgets have been furtively introduced to their own vehicles, a concept represented by the following meme:Of course, those in the know recognize this meme to be a joke, and a rather ridiculous one at that. But to whatever extent the meme “works,” it does so because it references an object that is common in the automotive world, yet many motorists remain unaware of what its actual function is.The object seen here is variously known as a “wheel weight,” a “balance weight, or a “wheel balance weight”:These weights have nothing to do with “tracking” — they are used during the process of a “wheel balance” (or “wheel rebalance”), a procedure that ensures tires and wheels have equal weight distribution so as to eliminate vibration and excessive or uneven tire wear:wheel balanceTire balancing is a tune-up for your wheel-tire set. It makes sure that weight is evenly distributed around the entire circumference of the unit. The common symptoms of out-of-balance tires are uneven and faster tread wear, poor fuel economy, and vibration in the steering wheel, the floorboard or the seat that gets worse at faster speeds.When all areas of the wheel-tire unit are as equal in weight as possible, the tire will roll smoothly. This helps it wear evenly, for longest life. Balancing also contributes to ride comfort: Imbalanced tires will wobble or hop up and down, which causes vibration. If a front tire isn’t properly balanced you’ll likely feel vibration in the steering wheel. If the problem is in the rear the tremor will be noticeable in the seat or floor.Imbalanced tires are easily corrected, but the work is precise. It’s done by attaching small weights, just fractions of ounces, to the wheel.Just half an ounce in weight difference is enough to cause a vibration when you’re driving.Tire balancing is a tune-up for your wheel-tire set.

Perhaps the most preposterous of these claims was that Thunberg was actually an Australian actress named Estella Renee who was delivering speeches on environmental issues not because she was concerned about the planet, but because she was a deep state crisis actor and paid to shill. discreditfalse rumorsdoctored photographsWhile researching this article we found at least three variations of the “Greta Thunberg is an actress” claim. They are as follows:Greta Thunberg is actually Australian actress Estelle Renee. Greta Thunberg has an IMDB page and this is proof that her environmental activism is disingenuous.Actress Estelle Renee is a crisis actor who portrayed a crying teenager (not Greta Thunberg) during a climate protest. Greta Thunberg is actually Australian actress Estelle Renee. Greta Thunberg has an IMDB page and this is proof that her environmental activism is disingenuous.Actress Estelle Renee is a crisis actor who portrayed a crying teenager (not Greta Thunberg) during a climate protest. We’ll take a deeper look at each of these items individually. Greta Thunberg is actually Australian actress Estelle Renee?Greta Thunberg is actually Australian actress Estelle Renee?Several social media users have claimed that Thunberg is actually an Australian actress named Estelle Renee. Facebook user Jack A. Schulman, for instance, wrote:claimedwroteAspiring Actress impersonates crying child climate activist at UN, impersonator is a sham.

She’s been on the public radar since at least September 2018 when she started staging climate protests in Sweden. Thunberg has also been nominated for numerous awards (including the Nobel Peace Prize), has met with several world leaders, and took a highly publicized voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. speechpublic radarFurthermore, we know the identity of Thunberg’s parents, Svante Thunberg and Malena Ernman, as well as her grandfather, Olof Thunberg, and her sister, Beata. identityIn other words, Greta Thunberg is not a “fictional character.” Her journey to becoming a global environmental activist has been well documented. Greta Thunberg has an IMDB page. Is this is proof that her environmental activism is disingenuous?Greta Thunberg has an IMDB page. Is this is proof that her environmental activism is disingenuous?A slightly less far-fetched version of this claim holds that Thunberg is listed as an “actress” on her IMDB page. While this is true, many have shared this screenshot as if it was somehow damaging to Thunberg’s reputation as an environmental activist:trueThunberg has one acting credit to her name. She lent her voice to a short film titled “Ave Paraíso” that was released in Spain in 2019. The remainder of her IMDB page simply lists appearances she’s made on television programs (such as “The Daily Show”) or in environmental documentaries where she is credited as herself. The fact that Thunberg has an IMDB page is often shared along with the insinuation that her environmental beliefs are not sincere. However, it should be noted that being an actor does not automatically disqualify someone from having an opinion, being an activist, or having a political career. Oscar-winner Leonardo DiCaprio, for instance, often lends his voice to environmental causes. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Ronald Reagan were both actors before embarking on political careers. Even U.S. President Donald Trump is listed as an “actor” on his IMDB page:Leonardo DiCaprioIMDBThe website Michael Smith News noted one additional detail about Thunberg’s IMDB page that seemingly hinted at the notion that she was a paid actress looking for new gigs. The website wrote that “you can talk to her agent if you’d like to book her for acting work” and then linked to an IMDB Pro link.

The video in question can be seen in the second of the following tweets:This young girl is so terrified about “climate change” she can’t even speak to a journalist about her fears without breaking down in tears.

However, these websites provided no evidence that this person was paid to appear at this protest or to “act” that they were concerned about the environment. And as we noted above, the fact that a person has acted or is an actor does not disqualify them from having personal beliefs. Star NowBrasier’s father spoke to Maarten Schenk of the debunking website LeadStories about this rumor:LeadStoriesThe events of that day are in the public domain and were on every TV station. The ideas and concerns expressed by Estella depicted in that video are entirely genuine, not paid for, she was not acting……Estella was not expecting to be interviewed by the media that day: it could have been her, it could have been anyone else. She was just standing closest to the cameras.It is possible to be both worried about climate-change and a child actress at the same time.The events of that day are in the public domain and were on every TV station.

45,,snopes,,"U.S. President Abraham Lincoln once said, """"If you want to test a man's character, give him power,"""" or words to that effect.",2019-09-25,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/lincoln-character-power/,,,,"In September 2019, we received multiple inquiries about the authenticity and provenance of a quotation widely attributed to U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. On Sept. 21, the right-leaning Facebook page Turning Point USA posted a meme that read:“‘If you want to test a man’s character, give him power.’ Abraham Lincoln.” The meme was accompanied by a caption that stated, “Big government is [sic] abuses its power!”  That quotation has been attributed to Lincoln for almost a century. Variations of it have appeared in multiple newspaper columns, it has been promulgated in countless memes and quotation compendiums, and it was widely shared when it was tweeted out by the writer J.K. Rowling in 2017.appearedmultiplenewspapercolumnsmemestweetedIt has been attributed to Lincoln in the U.S. Senate on three occasions, including two citations by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and the earliest Lincoln attribution we found was in the early 1930s. occasionstwocitationsearliestThe full quotation is usually given as, “Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man’s character, give him power.”In reality, Lincoln never uttered or wrote those words, or words to that effect. Rather, they were said about him. The original version of the quotation came on Jan. 16, 1883, during a speech in Washington, D.C., by the prominent writer and orator Robert Ingersoll. According to newspaper reports, Ingersoll was introducing another speaker, who was scheduled to give a lecture on Lincoln, at an unspecified “auditorium” in the nation’s capital. During the course of his introductory remarks (which were printed in full by the press), Ingersoll said:printedsaid“… If you want to know the difference between an orator and a speaker, read the oration of Lincoln at Gettysburg, and then read the speech of Everett at the same place. One came from the heart, the other was born only of the voice. Lincoln’s speech will be remembered forever. Everett’s no man will read. It was like plucked flowers. [Applause]. orationEverett“If you want to find out what a man is to the bottom, give him power. Any man can stand adversity — only a great man can stand prosperity. It is the glory of Abraham Lincoln that he never abused power only on the side of mercy. [Applause]. He was a perfectly honest man. When he had power, he used it in mercy …”If you want to find out what a man is to the bottom, give him power. Any man can stand adversity — only a great man can stand prosperityA modified version of those lines later appeared in published volumes of Ingersoll’s speeches and essays. For example, in his 1895 “Abraham Lincoln, a Lecture,” he wrote:wrote“Nothing discloses real character like the use of power. It is easy for the weak to be gentle. Most people can bear adversity. But if you wish to know what a man really is, give him power. This is the supreme test. It is the glory of Lincoln that, having almost absolute power, he never abused it, except on the side of mercy.”The exact same formulation of words appeared in Volume 3 of the 12-volume “Works of Robert G. Ingersoll,” which was published in 1902, three years after the well-known orator’s death. appearedFor a few decades, Ingersoll’s pithy praise of Lincoln was widely cited and correctly attributed in American newspapers, but the subject of the quotation appears to have been conflated with its author, beginning in the 1930s. Newspaper archives indicate that the quotation became increasingly condensed and increasingly attributed to Lincoln over the following decades, and in the present day Ingersoll’s original authorship has been almost entirely eclipsed. Turning Point USA was far from the first to mistakenly attribute the quotation to Lincoln in the site’s September 2019 meme, but the error was the latest prominent example in a list that stretches back almost 100 years.",[],"[{""id"" : 307"",""""begin"": 136,""end"": 151,""entity"": ""Abraham Lincoln"",""text"": ""Abraham Lincoln"",""score"": 0.61,""categories"" : [""1809 births"",""1865 deaths"",""Abraham Lincoln"",""American people of English descent"",""American people of Welsh descent"",""Assassinated heads of state"",""Assassinated United States Presidents"",""Deaths by firearm in Washington, D.C."",""Illinois lawyers"",""Illinois Republicans"",""Illinois Whigs"",""Lincoln family"",""Members of the Illinois House of Representatives"",""Members of the United States House of Representatives from Illinois"",""People from Coles County, Illinois"",""People from LaRue County, Kentucky"",""People from Macon County, Illinois"",""People from Spencer County, Indiana"",""People from Springfield, Illinois"",""People murdered in Washington, D.C."",""People of Illinois in the American Civil War"",""Political party founders"",""Postmasters"",""Presidents of the United States"",""United States presidents who died while in office"",""Republican Party Presidents of the United States"",""Republican Party (United States) presidential nominees"",""Smallpox survivors"",""Union political leaders"",""United States presidential candidates, 1860"",""United States presidential candidates, 1864""]},{""id"" : 7529378"",""""begin"": 180,""end"": 188,""entity"": ""Facebook"",""text"": ""Facebook"",""score"": 0.34,""categories"" : [""Facebook"",""Android (operating system) software"",""Bada software"",""BlackBerry software"",""Blog hosting services"",""Blog software"",""Internet properties established in 2004"",""IOS software"",""Online gaming services"",""Photo sharing"",""Social information processing"",""Social networking services"",""Student culture"",""Symbian software"",""Websites which mirror Wikipedia"",""Windows Phone software""]},{""id"" : 48160271"",""""begin"": 194,""end"": 211,""entity"": ""Turning Point USA"",""text"": ""Turning Point USA"",""score"": 0.55,""categories"" : []},{""id"" : 2018731"",""""begin"": 256,""end"": 261,""entity"": ""Military Intelligence Directorate (Israel)"",""text"": ""a man"",""score"": 0.33,""categories"" : [""Israeli intelligence agencies"",""Military intelligence agencies"",""Israel Defense Forces directorates"",""Military units and formations of Israel"",""Military units and formations established in 1950""]},{""id"" : 307"",""""begin"": 289,""end"": 304,""entity"": ""Abraham Lincoln"",""text"": ""Abraham Lincoln"",""score"": 0.54,""categories"" : [""1809 births"",""1865 deaths"",""Abraham Lincoln"",""American people of English descent"",""American people of Welsh descent"",""Assassinated heads of state"",""Assassinated United States Presidents"",""Deaths by firearm in Washington, D.C."",""Illinois lawyers"",""Illinois Republicans"",""Illinois Whigs"",""Lincoln family"",""Members of the Illinois House of Representatives"",""Members of the United States House of Representatives from Illinois"",""People from Coles County, Illinois"",""People from LaRue County, Kentucky"",""People from Macon County, Illinois"",""People from Spencer County, Indiana"",""People from Springfield, Illinois"",""People murdered in Washington, D.C."",""People of Illinois in the American Civil War"",""Political party founders"",""Postmasters"",""Presidents of the United States"",""United States presidents who died while in office"",""Republican Party Presidents of the United States"",""Republican Party (United States) presidential nominees"",""Smallpox survivors"",""Union political leaders"",""United States presidential candidates, 1860"",""United States presidential candidates, 1864""]},{""id"" : 16027"",""""begin"": 654,""end"": 664,""entity"": ""J.

While Clinton would eventually be impeached on charges such as “making false and misleading statements to potential grand jury witnesses,” this fake tweet is commenting on a bluntly (and incorrectly) boiled-down version of Clinton’s impeachment.impeachmentThis tweet does not appear on Lewinsky’s official Twitter timeline. We also searched a cached version of her page to see if the tweet had recently been deleted, but came up empty there, as well. timelineWhile we found a number of people sharing this message, they all did so by posting a text version of this message or by posting the above-displayed screenshot. We were unable to find any instances of a person retweeting the actual tweet link, nor any links to a genuine message that was recently deleted. actualThis tweet is also suspicious because the image indicates it was sent with “Twitter for Android.” Lewinksy’s tweets, however, are most often sent via iPhone. iPhoneThis fake tweet appears to have been created by the @electorotting (notice watermark in upper right-hand corner of image), an Instagram page that frequently posts political memes and jokes. While the account occasionally shares genuine posts from political leaders (Sen. Lindsey Graham truly once posted on Twitter “If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed … and we will deserve it”), the fake tweets shared by @electorotting all appear to be marked with the social media page’s watermark.  InstagramsharesSen.

47,,snopes,,NASA and NOAA faked climate data in the GISTEMP global temperature record to exaggerate global warming.,2019-10-03,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/global-warming-data-faked/,,,,"Since 2014, climate-change deniers have squeezed millions of views, Facebook shares, and Twitter retweets by retelling a story alleging the discovery of “faked” NASA data designed to “fit a climate change narrative.” Though copied almost wholesale from a blog post, the version of the story that has had the most online traction was published on the one-stop conspiracy theory/supplement shop that goes by the name Natural News. The article suggested:squeezedblog postsuggestedIn what might be the largest scientific fraud ever uncovered, NASA and the NOAA have been caught red-handed altering historical temperature data to produce a “climate change narrative” that defies reality. […] We now know that historical temperature data for the continental United States were deliberately altered by NASA and NOAA scientists in a politically-motivated attempt to rewrite history and claim global warming is causing U.S. temperatures to trend upward.In what might be the largest scientific fraud ever uncovered, NASA and the NOAA have been caught red-handed altering historical temperature data to produce a “climate change narrative” that defies reality. […] We now know that historical temperature data for the continental United States were deliberately altered by NASA and NOAA scientists in a politically-motivated attempt to rewrite history and claim global warming is causing U.S. temperatures to trend upward.There is a lot to unpack here, but the first thing you need to know is records of global surface temperatures are constantly refined based on the addition of new data, fresh statistical analyses, or new historical insight into the history of a specific source of data. Reporting on such a shift as something to “uncover” betrays a potentially willful ignorance of how climate science operates. These changes are publicly reported, based on stated scientific criteria, and subjected to rigorous internal and external peer review.constantly refinedWhere is this coming from?The “smoking gun” concerns a climate record known as the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP). These records are based on a massive global dataset of temperature stations from around the world, combining several collections of data originally collected by individual weather stations. The record provides “a measure of the changing global surface temperature with monthly resolution for the period since 1880, when a reasonably global distribution of meteorological stations was established.”GISTEMPprovidesTo argue for evidence of “faked” data, Natural News, as well as the original blog post, highlighted a version of the GISTEMP record for the United States first published in 1999, comparing it to one published later, in 2012. The record, these sources point out, has shifted:(These charts plot how far off each year’s average U.S. temperature differs from the average temperature for the entire period 1951–1980; the frame labeled “a” is from 1999.)chartsIt should be no shock that the data shifted following 1999, as illustrated graphically in the above diagram, because NASA published multiple papers in 1999 and 2001 about these changes and why they were made. Links to these papers can be found on the NASA website, which also publicly summarizes the changes in several other places.multiplepapers summarizesWhy adjust climate data?Writing for the climate information website Skeptical Science, Berkeley Earth research scientist Zeke Hausfather, whose work (in part) independently analyzes adjustments made by government agencies’ climate records, explained the need for making adjustments to such datasets in general. A primary misconception, he argues, is that an “unadjusted global temperature record” — which necessarily has to take into account not only the temperature reading at a given recording station, but also how to translate that data spatially to come up with a single annual or monthly number — is not really a thing that exists to begin with:Zeke HausfatherexplainedThere are a number of folks who question the need for adjustments at all. Why not just use raw temperatures, they ask, since those are pure and unadulterated? The problem is that … there is really no such thing as a pure and unadulterated temperature record. Temperature stations in the U.S. are mainly operated by volunteer observers (the Cooperative Observer Network, or co-op stations for short). Many of these stations were set up in the late 1800s and early 1900s as part of a national network of weather stations, focused on measuring day-to-day changes in the weather rather than decadal-scale changes in the climate.Nearly every single station in the network in the network has been moved at least once over the last century, with many having 3 or more distinct moves. Most of the stations have changed [the type of instruments used]. Observation times have shifted from afternoon to morning at most stations since 1960, as part of an effort by the National Weather Service to improve precipitation measurements.There are a number of folks who question the need for adjustments at all.

Observation times have shifted from afternoon to morning at most stations since 1960, as part of an effort by the National Weather Service to improve precipitation measurements.So what were the issues that led to changes between the 1999 record and the later record? According to NASA’s GISTEMP website, “Starting in the 1990s, the methodology took into account documented non-climatic biases in the raw data and eliminated or corrected unrealistic outliers.” The goal of these adjustments is to remove shoddy data from the dataset using pre-established methodologies, not to fit a “climate change narrative.”AccordingThese “non-climatic biases” include things like stations taking temperature measurements at different times of day, stations physically moving locations (sometimes to a different elevation), and other artifacts that produce change in a record not attributable to climate or weather. These non-climatic biases were identified and their method of adjustment described in a publicly available 2001 paper found, among other places, on NASA’s website. They included:includedTime of observation: Not all stations collect observations at the same time, and some stations — most significantly in the United States — have changed the time at which data is collected over time. Correcting for these effects is the most significant adjustment made to the GISTEMP dataset post-1999.Station location history: Sometimes stations move to another location, affecting the record. Post-1999 records take this into account.Change in thermometer type: A well-defined shift in data came from a change from liquid-in-glass thermometers to the maximum-minimum temperature system (MMTS). Post-1999 records take this into account.Urban heat effect: Densely populated urban areas retain heat more than rural areas. An increase in stations in urban areas over time, for example, would create a false warming trend. Post 1999 records take this into account as well.Time of observation: Not all stations collect observations at the same time, and some stations — most significantly in the United States — have changed the time at which data is collected over time.

The methods used and their effect on the data are all disclosed online. However the issues described above are largely moot at the time of this writing in 2019. The GISTEMP analyses at issue above concern a formulation of the dataset (GISTEMP v3) that has been replaced by an improved model named GISTEMP v4, which includes a much larger set of data and a whole other set of adjustments.employ modelsGISTEMP v4“Caught red-handed”All told, the most significant effect of all these changes came from the time-of-day adjustments. Collectively, the adjustments served to produce a slightly increased warming trend in the United States record compared to the earlier records.warming trendThe largest adjustments are the time of observation debiasing and station history adjustment, each of which increases the mean warming over the United States by about 0.15ºC over the 100 years.

The net of all five adjustments to the … record is a warming of about 0.3ºCTo suggest — 14 years after the fact — that identifying publicly discussed adjustments to raw data whose methods have been published in peer-reviewed journals represents catching scientists “red-handed” in “the largest scientific fraud ever uncovered” exposes only the ignorance of the author, not some nefarious sleight of hand by climate scientists. As such, the claim is rated “False.”",[],"[{""id"" : 7529378"",""""begin"": 65,""end"": 73,""entity"": ""Facebook"",""text"": ""Facebook"",""score"": 0.37,""categories"" : [""Facebook"",""Android

Then she took her jacket off, revealing a T-shirt that read, “Save the planet. Eat the children.”T-shirtThe woman said she was glad Ocasio-Cortez supported the Green New Deal but stated it was not enough. “Your new campaign slogan has to be this,” she stated, taking her jacket off and revealing the shirt. “We got to start eating babies. We don’t have enough time. … Even if you would bomb Russia, we still have too many people, too much pollution!”Words and images from the event shared online prompted reactions from many, including U.S. President Donald Trump and his eldest son, Donald Jr.includingSeems like a normal AOC supporter to me. https://t.co/NWVMRD0wsl— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 4, 2019Seems like a normal AOC supporter to me. https://t.co/NWVMRD0wslhttps://t.co/NWVMRD0wsl— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 4, 2019October 4, 2019During the town hall, Ocasio-Cortez responded to the woman by talking about the need for positive solutions to climate change and concluding, “We are never beyond hope” before quickly moving on to another question.Although some on the political right criticized her response, Ocasio-Cortez followed up on Twitter by explaining that she had been operating under the assumption that the woman was mentally ill and in crisis.somerightThis person may have been suffering from a mental condition and it’s not okay that the right-wing is mocking her and potentially make her condition or crisis worse.

Sweet, who has studied the group’s history, told the Post that the woman’s stunt fell in line with their standard operating procedures. “The tactic,” Sweet told the Post, “is you go to a political meeting and you create a disturbance that disrupts the meeting, and more importantly, that creates a kind of chaos.”describedThe group, dubbed LaRouchians, has been around for decades, and was founded by conspiracy crank Lyndon LaRouche, who died in February 2019 at the age of 96 after building a “worldwide following based on conspiracy theories, economic doom, anti-Semitism, homophobia and racism.”buildingLaRouche’s conspiracy theories involve proffering claims that the Queen of England controls the international drug trade and that Adolf Hitler, whose forces bombed England in World War II, was a British agent.controlsagent",[],"[{""id"" : 645042"",""""begin"": 33,""end"": 46,""entity"": ""New York City"",""text"": ""New York City"",""score"": 0.40,""categories"" : [""New York

49,,snopes,,Videos have captured strange apocalyptic sounds coming from the sky all around the world.,2015-04-30,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-sound-of-apocalypse/,,,,"On 10 April 2015, the web site Latin Post shared a video purportedly featuring “strange apocalyptic sounds coming from the sky all around the world.” That video comprises clips from various videos uploaded to YouTube between 2011 and 2013; and while it’s impossible for us to offer a comprehensive explanation covering every clip seen in that video, we can provide a skeptical look about the alleged “apocalyptic noises” it references.Latin PostLatin PostThis video claims that there has been creepy strange noises around the world, many of the comments under these videos are very “world coming to an end” type comments. People are claiming they are trumpets playing. There is no scientific explanation for these noises. I just want to know it it’s nonsense or not.This video claims that there has been creepy strange noises around the world, many of the comments under these videos are very “world coming to an end” type comments. People are claiming they are trumpets playing. There is no scientific explanation for these noises. I just want to know it it’s nonsense or not.Unusual and unexplained noises are recorded in various locations around the world from time to time. While the specific origins of all such sounds may not yet be known, most scientific research points to natural causes such as tidal waves, methane explosions, underground earthquakes, or shifting sand dunes as explanations for these aural phenomena:researchThere are many potential explanations, according to David Hill, a scientist at the US Geological Survey, who wrote a recent scientific review paper rounding up the causes of mystery booms. In coastal regions, for instance, large bangs may accompany humungous waves hitting the cliffs; reports of thunderous sounds are apparently common among big-wave surfers in the US.Hill suspects that earthquakes are to blame in the majority of cases. He’s talking from experience; while in California’s Mammoth Mountain he was surrounded by a muffled booming sound, despite feeling no shaking. On inspecting his instruments he found evidence of small earthquakes less than 4 km (2.9 miles) below the surface. Whereas sounds of deeper earthquakes may be too low for human hearing, he has calculated that judders near the surface could transmit audible noises of the cracking crust.There are many potential explanations, according to David Hill, a scientist at the US Geological Survey, who wrote a recent scientific review paper rounding up the causes of mystery booms.

Whereas sounds of deeper earthquakes may be too low for human hearing, he has calculated that judders near the surface could transmit audible noises of the cracking crust.Although it is likely that “strange apocalyptic” booming sounds seemingly issuing from the sky have an earthly origin, USGS scientist David Hill said that it’s also possible some of these noises originate from above:You might think it unlikely that we would miss the flash of a meteor, but it’s not impossible, as Hill notes: ‘Because of the time required for a sonic shock wave to reach the Earth’s surface from the upper atmosphere, the visible trace of the meteor has usually vanished before its sonic boom is heard.’You might think it unlikely that we would miss the flash of a meteor, but it’s not impossible, as Hill notes: ‘Because of the time required for a sonic shock wave to reach the Earth’s surface from the upper atmosphere, the visible trace of the meteor has usually vanished before its sonic boom is heard.’Is that what we’re hearing in the video above — a distant earthquake or a passing meteor? Although some of the sounds captured in the video may have natural explanations, some of the other noises clearly originated from a common, artificial source: an iPhone.At the 4:45 mark in the above-displayed video, a clip purportedly taken in Alberta, Canada, begins to play and (like all of the other clips in this video) features a strange and seemingly unexplainable noise. But this section of the video is unique in having a definitive explanation: YouTube user DangleSnipeCelly08 admitted that the clip she uploaded on 14 January 2012 was a hoax:admittedI made the video by taking out my iPhone and merely video recorded my balcony view while holding my laptop right behind it, while my laptop played (another video featuring strange sounds) in the background. Took less than a minute to do this.I made it because I was surprised at the attention (these videos were) getting, and the friends on my Facebook friends list were voicing their fear, which I think is wrong. I easily found that the Conklin video and I believe the Ukraine video has the exact same audio on them (hello Tropical birds in Conklin), so I decided that I had to share my knowledge. I made the video to show my friends and family how easy it was (literally less than five minutes of my life to make the video and upload it) to make something like that, and how they shouldn’t believe everything they see online, and should especially not get fearful.I made the video by taking out my iPhone and merely video recorded my balcony view while holding my laptop right behind it, while my laptop played (another video featuring strange sounds) in the background.

Although it’s possible that a recurring natural phenomenon has been captured in various locations around the world, it is more plausible that a single audio stream was duplicated and embedded into multiple video clips.Latin PostStill, the original noise had to come from somewhere. So is this noise natural, or supernatural? The most likely answer is that the sound came from Hollywood:Even if the majority of clips in the video shared by Latin Post do not feature “apocalyptic noises” coming from the sky, the world is not void of unexplainable noises. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) still don’t know where the whistle over the Pacific Ocean originates, researchers are still unsure of what causes a mysterious “humming” noise heard by many people in Britain, and the USGS still hasn’t identified a cause for “skyquakes” booms.Latin Postwhistlehummingskyquakes",[],"[{""id"" : 3524766"",""""begin"": 205,""end"": 212,""entity"": ""YouTube"",""text"": ""YouTube"",""score"": 0.42,""categories"" : [""YouTube"",""2005 establishments in the United States"",""Article Feedback 5 Additional Articles"",""Companies based in San Mateo County, California"",""Companies established in 2005"",""Entertainment websites"",""Google acquisitions"",""Google services"",""Internet companies of the United States"",""Internet properties established in 2005"",""Multilingual websites"",""Video hosting"",""Video on demand services""]},{""id"" : 2681261"",""""begin"": 728,""end"": 733,""entity"": ""Laconic phrase"",""text"": ""it it"",""score"": 0.51,""categories"" : [""Rhetoric""]},{""id"" : 2681261"",""""begin"": 1033,""end"": 1038,""entity"": ""Laconic phrase"",""text"": ""it it"",""score"": 0.51,""categories"" : [""Rhetoric""]},{""id"" : 18582230"",""""begin"": 1294,""end"": 1301,""entity"": ""Methane"",""text"": ""methane"",""score"": 0.46,""categories"" : [""Methane"",""Anaerobic digestion"",""Greenhouse gases"",""Fuels"",""Fuel gas""]},{""id"" : 7674400"",""""begin"": 1461,""end"": 1471,""entity"": ""David Hill (Oregon politician)"",""text"": ""David Hill"",""score"": 0.36,""categories"" : [""People from Hillsboro, Oregon"",""Champoeg Meetings"",""Members of the Provisional Government of Oregon"",""Members of the Oregon Territorial Legislature"",""1809 births"",""1850 deaths"",""Burials at Hillsboro Pioneer Cemetery"",""Oregon pioneers""]},{""id"" : 252000"",""""begin"": 1891,""end"": 1907,""entity"": ""Mammoth Mountain"",""text"": ""Mammoth Mountain"",""score"": 0.37,""categories"" : [""Lava domes"",""Mountains of Madera County, California"",""Mountains of Mono County, California"",""Volcanoes of Madera County, California"",""Volcanoes of Mono County, California"",""Inyo National Forest"",""Mountains of the Sierra Nevada (U.S.)""]},{""id"" : 13681879"",""""begin"": 2184,""end"": 2191,""entity"": ""Living on the Edge (UK TV series)"",""text"": ""judders"",""score"": 0.50,""categories"" : []},{""id"" : 673717"",""""begin"": 2312,""end"": 2322,""entity"": ""David B.

For instance, some started sharing a doctored photograph of Thunberg with alt-right boogeyman George Soros (the original photograph featured former Vice President Al Gore). Others shared a miscaptioned image purportedly showing Thunberg with a member of ISIS (Thunberg was not in this photograph.)spotlightdoctored photographmiscaptioned imageAnother image purported to show Thunberg on the cover of People with Money magazine after she was named the “highest paid activist.” imageThis is not a genuine magazine cover. This image was created by the website MediaMass from a template the site has frequently employed in the past. Since at least 2013, MediaMass has created dozens of fake magazine covers of “highest paid” people. These doctored images have featured celebrities such as John Legend, Chuck Norris, Bob Dylan, Susan Boyle, and Reba McEntire:These covers are all identical with the exception of the main image. It appears that MediaMass simply places a basic template over a photograph of a celebrity.Here’s a look at the blank template: MediaMass published its fake magazine cover featuring Thunberg in an article titled “Greta Thunberg Highest-Paid Activist in the World.” While the article initially reads like a genuine magazine piece, an update after the first paragraph explained that the rumor was false. Those who clicked on the explanation were directed to a disclaimer about MediaMass’ content: articledisclaimerThe website mediamass.net is the medium of our satire to expose with humour, exaggeration and ridicule the contemporary mass production and mass consumption that we observe.Also it will not only mock the producers (mainstream media, journalists) as it is common when questioning and criticizing mass media, but also the consumers as one cannot exist without the other.

However, such a post was not visible on her page on Sept. 24, which means we cannot verify that it originated there, though it is possible the post had been deleted or removed from public view by then.promotesWhatever the origins of Potter’s post, the images contained in the collage were either doctored, did not show Thunberg, or included a misleading description.Thunberg with Isis?Thunberg with Isis?The above image does not show Thunberg. It was taken during a Quran recital contest hosted by Isis members in Aleppo, Syria, in 2013, as we outlined in an earlier fact check article.fact checkThunberg with George Soros?Thunberg with George Soros?This image does show Thunberg, but the face of financier and philanthropist George Soros has been digitally superimposed onto the body of the man standing next to her. The original photograph actually pictured former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and was posted to Twitter by Thunberg in December 2018:Thank you @algore for being a true pioneer.

She posted it to her Twitter account in July 2019 as part of a campaign to promote the band The 1975, which featured a speech by Thunberg and was set to be the opening track on The 1975’s forthcoming album “Notes on a Conditional Form.”campaignspeechThe original photograph showed the band’s lead singer Matt Healy sitting next to Thunberg, who wore a T-shirt bearing the slogan “Antifascist All Stars”:originalOpposing fascism or wearing an “Antifascist All Stars” T-shirt does not necessarily make one a member or supporter of “Antifa,” a frequently misunderstood and misused term that describes a movement of typically militant and sometimes violent left-wing activists in the United States and beyond.AntifaDespite those nuances, Thunberg appears to have received criticism from some quarters for her decision to wear the T-shirt, and she eventually deleted the original photograph from her social media account. In a subsequent tweet, she offered an explanation that made it clear she had intended only to express her opposition to fascism, and that she rejected the use of violence:Yesterday I posted a photo wearing a borrowed T-shirt that says I’m against fascism. That T-shirt can apparently to some be linked to a violent movement. I don’t support any form of violence and to avoid misunderstandings I’ve deleted the post. And of course I am against fascism.— Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) July 26, 2019Yesterday I posted a photo wearing a borrowed T-shirt that says I’m against fascism. That T-shirt can apparently to some be linked to a violent movement. I don’t support any form of violence and to avoid misunderstandings I’ve deleted the post. And of course I am against fascism.— Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) July 26, 2019July 26, 2019 Given the inherent ambiguity of meaning in wearing the T-shirt, as well as Thunberg’s subsequent explanation and deletion of her tweet, it is difficult to support the characterization of the photograph contained in the meme, which claimed Thunberg had “aligned” herself with Antifa.The description of Antifa as a “terrorist organization” is also questionable. In the U.S., the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) does not currently list Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, but the summer of 2019 saw increasing calls for such a designation.In July, Republican Senators Bill Cassidy (Louisiana) and Ted Cruz (Texas) introduced a U.S. Senate resolution calling for “groups and organizations across the country who act under the banner of Antifa to be designated as domestic terrorist organizations.” In August, President Donald Trump warned, in a tweet that “Major consideration is being given to naming Antifa an ‘organization of terror.'”resolutionwarnedAside from the lack of any official designation, no fixed, universally accepted definition of “terrorist” or “terrorist organization” exists, so the question of whether Antifa — which is more a transnational movement than a traditional, hierarchical organization — should be labeled as such is ultimately a matter for subjective argument.",[],"[{""id"" : 23692256"",""""begin"": 137,""end"": 144,""entity"": ""The T.O.

53,,snopes,,Pizza Hut and Papa John's are refusing to deliver pizzas to striking GM workers because the companies don't support the union.,2019-09-24,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/pizza-hut-papa-johns-gm-strike/,,,,"Amidst a union strike led by General Motors employees with the United Auto Workers trade union, a rumor spread on Facebook reporting that the Pizza Hut and Papa John’s pizza chains were refusing to deliver pies to union halls because those companies did not support the strike:strikeAside from the more vaguely-worded post above, some posted messages on Facebook reported that specific store locations had refused to deliver to their respective union halls.Our phone message and email to Pizza Hut went unanswered, but when we reached out to Papa John’s, spokeswoman Lindsay English told us reports that the chain was denying service to striking workers were untrue. English sent a statement that read: “Claims that we refuse to deliver to anyone involved with the ongoing strike is untrue. If the location is within our delivery area, we are happy to deliver, if not, we encourage you to place a carry out order.”We sent an email via UAW to some of the people posting about the rumor on Facebook but haven’t yet received any response. According to television station KTVI, the Wentzville, Missouri, pizza shop called Marco’s delivered dozens of pizzas to striking workers in a show of support.KTVIAbout 49,000 GM workers went on strike on September 16, 2019, when contract negotiations between UAW and the corporation floundered. The union is demanding things like better treatment of temporary workers, wages, and benefits for workers.

He claimed that, in order to test the structure’s resistance, the administration had invited 20 “world-class mountain-climbers” to attempt to scale various border-fence prototypes. “This was the one that was hardest to climb,” Trump said, gesturing toward the fence. He continued:“We’ve all seen the pictures of young people climbing walls with drugs on their back. A lot of drugs, they’re unbelievable climbers. This wall can’t be climbed. This is very, very hard. What the panel does on top, as I said, is structural, but it’s also very hard to get by that panel. Plus, it’s designed to absorb heat. So it’s extremely hot. The wall is — you won’t be able to touch it, you can fry an egg on that wall. It’s very, very hot. So if they’re going to climb it, they’re going to have to bring hoses and water and we don’t know where they’re going to hook it up because there’s not a lot of water out here. So it’s a very, very hard thing to climb.” ﻿ ﻿﻿Significant and substantive doubts have been raised about the veracity of Trump’s claim that preparations for the construction of the border involved 20 “world-class mountain-climbers” testing various fence models, and the White House did not respond to our request for clarification.doubtsNotwithstanding that factual uncertainty, it’s clear that Trump’s Sept. 18 boasts were specifically about the new model of border fence being erected along the southern border in 2019, in particular the section at Otay Mesa, next to which the press conference took place. By contrast, the video footage and still images used to contradict and ridicule the president’s claim that “this wall can’t be climbed” were either captured in 2016, before construction began on Trump’s long-promised border fence, and even before he became president, or at a section of fencing that is clearly, visibly different from the one the president showed off in September 2019.The video footage that showed two young men quickly scaling a fence, with backpacks that may have contained drugs, was captured in March 2016, at a section of border fencing near Nogales, Arizona. The video was shot by a news crew from the Mexican television channel Azteca Trece (now known as Azteca Uno), and can be viewed below: ﻿﻿﻿Trump appeared to reference this very video in his September 2019 remarks, saying “We’ve all seen the pictures of young people climbing walls with drugs on their back. … This wall can’t be climbed.” So the president was saying that the wall next to him, at Otay Mesa, could not be climbed, unlike the type of wall seen in the March 2016 video footage. It is therefore particularly disingenuous for online commentators to use that very footage to undermine or ridicule Trump’s claims. The two fence models bore certain similarities, but did appear to have significant differences. In particular, the fence climbed in a matter of seconds at Nogales, in March 2016, visibly did not have a panel at the top (as the newer model does) — a feature that might well have prevented the young men from surmounting the fence and making their descent on the other side.The graphic below shows the top of the fence climbed in March 2016, on the left, and the top of the fence that the president said “can’t be climbed,” in September 2019:In a September tweet, @stonecold2050 used a still image of several men climbing a fence in order to illustrate the claim that, contrary to the president’s assertions, “Mexicans have turned Trump’s wall into a tourist attraction and are playing a game to see who can climb it the fastest.”Trump visited the US border this week & said rock climbers tested his wall & agreed it cannot be climbed.

It appeared to be considerably shorter, and it also lacked the paneling present at the top of the Otay Mesa fence, as shown in the graphic below:Overall, the social media posts that endeavored to ridicule or undermine Trump’s boasts about the new model of border fencing at Otay Mesa were grossly misleading, because they used video and still images taken from other fences at other locations and at earlier dates, and those fences had significant and substantive structural differences from the fencing unveiled in September 2019.Posts that used video footage of two young men scaling a border fence in March 2016 were especially disingenuous, because Trump himself specifically contrasted the integrity of the fencing seen in that footage with the newer model of fencing that he showed off to the media in September 2019.",[],"[{""id"" : 4848272"",""""begin"": 75,""end"": 87,""entity"": ""Donald Trump"",""text"": ""Donald Trump"",""score"": 0.67,""categories"" : [""Living people"",""1946 births"",""20th-century American businesspeople"",""20th-century American writers"",""21st-century American businesspeople"",""21st-century American writers"",""American billionaires"",""American business writers"",""American casino industry businesspeople"",""American chief executives"",""American construction businesspeople"",""American cosmetics businesspeople"",""American education businesspeople"",""American fashion businesspeople"",""American game show hosts"",""American people of German descent"",""American people of Scottish descent"",""American Presbyterians"",""American real estate businesspeople"",""American reality television producers"",""American restaurateurs"",""American socialites"",""Businesspeople from Florida"",""Businesspeople from New York City"",""Businesspeople in the beverage industry"",""Conspiracy theorists"",""Fordham University alumni"",""New York Military Academy alumni"",""New York Republicans"",""Participants in American reality television series"",""People from Manhattan"",""People from Palm Beach, Florida"",""People from Queens"",""Television producers from New York"",""Trump family"",""United States Football League executives"",""Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania alumni"",""Writers from Florida"",""Writers from New York City"",""Article Feedback 5 Additional Articles""]},{""id"" : 53033309"",""""begin"": 458,""end"": 470,""entity"": ""Executive Order 13767"",""text"": ""Trump’s wall"",""score"": 0.35,""categories"" : []},{""id"" : 53033309"",""""begin"": 730,""end"": 742,""entity"": ""Executive Order 13767"",""text"": ""Trump’s wall"",""score"": 0.35,""categories"" : []},{""id"" : 9988187"",""""begin"": 880,""end"": 887,""entity"": ""Twitter"",""text"": ""twitter"",""score"": 0.34,""categories"" : [""2006 establishments in the United States"",""Companies based in San Francisco, California"",""Internet companies of the United States"",""Internet properties established in 2006"",""Privately held companies based in California"",""Real-time web"",""Social networking services"",""Text messaging"",""Twitter"",""Social networking websites"",""IOS software"",""Android (operating system) software""]},{""id"" : 53033309"",""""begin"": 1066,""end"": 1078,""entity"": ""Executive Order 13767"",""text"": ""Trump’s wall"",""score"": 0.35,""categories"" : []},{""id"" : 9988187"",""""begin"": 1216,""end"": 1223,""entity"": ""Twitter"",""text"": ""twitter"",""score"": 0.38,""categories"" : [""2006 establishments in the United States"",""Companies based in San Francisco, California"",""Internet companies of the United States"",""Internet properties established in 2006"",""Privately held companies based in California"",""Real-time web"",""Social networking services"",""Text messaging"",""Twitter"",""Social networking websites"",""IOS software"",""Android (operating system) software""]},{""id"" : 1237220"",""""begin"": 1358,""end"": 1371,""entity"": ""Patton Oswalt"",""text"": ""Patton Oswalt"",""score"": 0.58,""categories"" : [""1969 births"",""20th-century actors"",""21st-century actors"",""Actors from Virginia"",""American film actors"",""American atheists"",""American stand-up comedians"",""American television actors"",""American television writers"",""American voice actors"",""American video game actors"",""American comics writers"",""College of William & Mary alumni"",""Living people"",""People from Burbank, California"",""People from Portsmouth, Virginia"",""People from Loudoun County, Virginia"",""Sub Pop artists"",""Warner Bros.

55,,snopes,,"Ted Livingston, the CEO of Kik Interactive, announced in September 2019 that the Kik messaging app would be shutting down.",2019-09-24,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/is-kik-messenger-app-shutting-down/,,,,"On Sept. 24, 2019, a number of news outlets reported that the messaging app Kik would be shutting down. According to the BBC:news outletsreportedKik Messenger is shutting down despite the service having millions of active users around the world.The company said it was closing down the messaging service so it could concentrate on the Kin cryptocurrency it has also created.Kik Messenger is shutting down despite the service having millions of active users around the world.The company said it was closing down the messaging service so it could concentrate on the Kin cryptocurrency it has also created.The news came as a shock to many Kik users, especially because, as of this writing, an official statement about the messenger app shutting down had not been posted to the company’s website or official Twitter or Facebook pages. To confuse matters further, an unrelated hoax about Ted Livingston, the CEO of Kik Interactive, was circulated in the aftermath of these reports.    company’s websiteTwitterFacebookhoaxLivingston announced that the Kik messenger app was closing in a Medium blog post published on Sept. 23 about the company’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the cryptocurrency Kin. Livingston wrote that the company’s legal fight with the SEC had drained resources and led to some hard decisions, such as closing down the messenger app. Medium blog postLivingston wrote (emphasis ours): After 18 months of working with the SEC the only choice they gave us was to either label Kin a security or fight them in court. Becoming a security would kill the usability of any cryptocurrency and set a dangerous precedent for the industry. So with the SEC working to characterize almost all cryptocurrencies as securities we made the decision to step forward and fight.While we are ready to take on the SEC in court, we underestimated the tactics they would employ. How they would take our quotes out of context to manipulate the public to view us as bad actors. How they would pressure exchanges not to list Kin. And how they would draw out a long and expensive process to drain our resources.Instead of selling some of our Kin into the limited liquidity that exists today, we made the decision to focus our current resources on the few things that matter most. So today we are announcing three things:We will shut down the Kik appWe will reduce our headcount to an elite 19 person teamWe will focus on one thing: converting Kin users into Kin buyersThese are hard decisions. Kik is one of the largest apps in the US. It has industry leading engagement and is growing again. Over 100 employees and their families will be impacted. People who have poured their hearts and souls into Kik and Kin for over a decade.After 18 months of working with the SEC the only choice they gave us was to either label Kin a security or fight them in court.

People who have poured their hearts and souls into Kik and Kin for over a decade.Livingston provided few details about the shuttering of Kik. Some Kik users reported encountering a message on the chat app about Kik shutting down on Sept. 27, but a spokesperson for the company told us that this was not an official message from the Kik team: We can confirm that Kik will be shutting down but the timing and details of the user experience has not yet been shared – that will be released in the coming days.The post you attached (claiming that Kik would shut down on Sept. 27) is not true. We can confirm that Kik will be shutting down but the timing and details of the user experience has not yet been shared – that will be released in

Although it is highly offensive, news reports occasionally arise of high-profile white celebrities or politicians who made it part of a Halloween costume or performance.stems fromHalloween costumeperformanceIn recent history, the U.S. has had two elected black governors.

Bernie Sanders.,2019-09-24,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/msnbc-graphic-bernie-sanders/,,,,"Did a graphic showing 2020 Democratic presidential candidates on the liberal cable news network MSNBC exclude U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders? It did, and it remains unclear why, though Sanders wasn’t the only candidate left off.The infographic aired during a report on Iowa’s Polk County Steak Fry, an event on Sept. 21, 2019, that drew 17 candidates to Iowa ahead of that state’s caucuses, including Sanders, an Independent from Vermont who is running as a Democrat.17 candidates!function(r,u,m,b,l,e){r._Rumble=b,r[b]||(r[b]=function(){(r[b]._=r[b]._||[]).push(arguments);if(r[b]._.length==1){l=u.createElement(m),e=u.getElementsByTagName(m)[0],l.async=1,l.src='https://rumble.com/embedJS/ucxbq'+(arguments[1].video?'.'+arguments[1].video:'')+'/?url='+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+'&args='+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify([].slice.apply(arguments))),e.parentNode.insertBefore(l,e)}})}(window, document, 'script', 'Rumble');!function(r,u,m,b,l,e){r._Rumble=b,r[b]||(r[b]=function(){(r[b]._=r[b]._||[]).push(arguments);if(r[b]._.length==1){l=u.createElement(m),e=u.getElementsByTagName(m)[0],l.async=1,l.src='https://rumble.com/embedJS/ucxbq'+(arguments[1].video?'.'+arguments[1].video:'')+'/?url='+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+'&args='+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify([].slice.apply(arguments))),e.parentNode.insertBefore(l,e)}})}(window, document, 'script', 'Rumble');       Rumble('play', {'video': 'v5m30b','div': 'rumble_v5m30b','autoplay':2});It’s unclear why the graphic pictured only 10 candidates, even as host Richard Lui reported that 17 were present at the Iowa event. But a screenshot of the image ricocheted around social media alongside claims that MSNBC was suppressing news about Sanders. One such accusation was lobbed by “High Fidelity” film actor John Cusack.       Rumble('play', {'video': 'v5m30b','div': 'rumble_v5m30b','autoplay':2});claimsWow u must be like – “insane “ – or something for noticing completely obvious things RT @ACleverNickname: @rev_sturdivant @YNB @johncusack @MeganKelleyHall @ZerlinaMaxwell Imagine believing this graphic wasn’t broadcast yesterday pic.twitter.com/anHAmZ8cFC— John Cusack (@johncusack) September 23, 2019Wow u must be like – “insane “ – or something for noticing completely obvious things RT @ACleverNickname: @rev_sturdivant @YNB @johncusack @MeganKelleyHall @ZerlinaMaxwell Imagine believing this graphic wasn’t broadcast yesterday pic.twitter.com/anHAmZ8cFC@ACleverNickname@rev_sturdivant@YNB@johncusack@MeganKelleyHall@ZerlinaMaxwellpic.twitter.com/anHAmZ8cFC— John Cusack (@johncusack) September 23, 2019September 23, 2019We sent questions to MSNBC media representatives asking why the graphic did not include Sanders, but received no response at the time of publication.The graphic features the faces of candidates U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.; Michael Bennet, D-Colo.; Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; Cory Booker, D-N.J.; and Kamala Harris, D-Calif. It also shows former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden; former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro; author Marianne Williamson; South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg; and U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii.Sanders was left out of the image but so were other fellow candidates, including entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Beto O’Rourke. Nine of the 10 candidates pictured attended a forum in Iowa on LGBTQ civil rights issues (Joe Sestak, a former U.S. Representative from Pennsylvania, attended the forum but was not pictured).forumThe screen-captured graphic is likely one piece of visual information taken out of a larger context. A simple Google search for the terms “MSNBC” and “Bernie Sanders” reveals that the network regularly covers Sanders, while a search on the television-monitoring site TVEyes reveals mentions of Bernie Sanders appeared in closed-captioning 26 times on MSNBC over the weekend in question.The Iowa caucus is seen as an important benchmark in Democratic primary races because it comes first and is often, though not always, an indicator of who will get the party’s nomination for the general election.not always",[],"[{""id"" : 19280734"",""""begin"": 69,""end"": 76,""entity"": ""Liberalism"",""text"":

58,,snopes,,"As part of a federal lawsuit, U.S. President Donald Trump admitted criminal wrongdoing and said or argued to the effect that """"My crimes can't be investigated while I'm president.""""",2019-09-23,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-my-crimes-investigated/,,,,"In September 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the veracity of claims that U.S. President Donald Trump had admitted criminal wrongdoing and said, “My crimes can’t be investigated while I’m president,” or that he or his lawyers had made a legal argument to that effect.On Sept. 19, Vanity Fair published an article with the headline, “Trump: My Crimes Can’t Be Investigated While I’m President,” which went on to report that the president’s attorneys had devised a “novel” legal argument to prevent the involuntary release of their client’s federal tax returns. Vanity Fair summarized that argument as being, “It’s illegal to investigate a sitting president for any crimes he may have committed.”articleThe article continued:“In a lawsuit filed today against Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., who recently subpoenaed eight years of Trump’s tax returns to determine if the Trump Organization falsified business records relating to Stormy Daniels payments, the president’s lawyers claim such a request is unconstitutional because the founding fathers believed sitting presidents should not be subject to the criminal process.“‘The framers of our Constitution understood that state and local prosecutors would be tempted to criminally investigate the president to advance their own careers and to advance their political agendas,’ the suit reads. ‘And they likewise understood that having to defend against these actions would distract the president from his constitutional duties.'”The Vanity Fair article did not quote Trump or any of his representatives or lawyers admitting any criminal action on his part, and it attributed the legal argument in question to the president’s lawyers (not the president himself). The article also made clear that the statement, “It’s illegal to investigate a sitting president for any crimes he may have committed,” was the author’s own summary of what Trump’s attorneys had written, rather than a direct quotation from their court filings. Despite all that nuance, the article’s headline had the effect of badly misleading those who did not carefully read the article itself. “Trump: My Crimes Can’t Be Investigated While I’m President” demonstrably created the false impression, among many readers, that Trump himself (as opposed to his lawyers) had said (rather than argued to the effect that), “My crimes can’t be investigated while I’m president,” and that in doing so, Trump or his lawyers had admitted wrongdoing on the part of the president.Trump did not say that nor did his lawyers. Nor did his lawyers even present an argument that could fairly be summarized in that way because, in making the argument they made, his lawyers did not admit any criminal actions on Trump’s part.Unfortunately, the misleading nature of the article’s headline was borne out in full. The Twitter account @stonecold2050 tweeted a link to the Vanity Fair article, adding, “Trump says ‘my crimes can’t be investigated while I’m the president of the United States.’ ‘My Crimes,’ What did he just say?”Trump says “my crimes can’t be investigated while I’m the president of the United States”“My Crimes” What did he just say?#ImpeachTrumphttps://t.co/c3iQ86DThG— Stone 🥶 (@stonecold2050) September 20, 2019Trump says “my crimes can’t be investigated while I’m the president of the United States”“My Crimes” What did he just say?#ImpeachTrumphttps://t.co/c3iQ86DThG#ImpeachTrumphttps://t.co/c3iQ86DThG— Stone 🥶 (@stonecold2050) September 20, 2019September 20, 2019 That widely shared tweet was one of many social media posts that clearly demonstrated an understanding of the article’s headline as meaning that Trump had himself explicitly admitted to having committed crimes. himselfThe left-leaning The Other 98% Facebook page further promulgated that false impression, borrowing from @stonecold2050’s tweet: Comments posted on Vanity Fair’s own Facebook page, and in response to its own tweeting of the article, clearly show that a considerable number of readers, without any editorial mediation, understood the headline to mean that Trump himself had admitted to criminal wrongdoing and said, “My crimes can’t be investigated while I’m president.”postedresponseAnalysisThe passages quoted in the Vanity Fair article were taken from a civil complaint by Trump against New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance, filed on Sept. 19 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.The key argument made by Trump’s lawyers in that complaint was that Vance’s efforts to obtain the president’s tax returns, by issuing a subpoena to his accountants at Mazars, were an unconstitutional effort to advance a criminal investigation into a sitting president:complaint“Because the Mazars subpoena attempts to criminally investigate a sitting president, it is unconstitutional. This court should declare it invalid and enjoin its enforcement until the president is no longer in office.”To that extent, the Vanity Fair article was accurate in summarizing the argument as being, “It’s illegal to investigate a sitting president for any crimes he may have committed,” though it is worth stipulating that occupants of the White House can (and have been) investigated as part of federal civil lawsuits if those suits don’t relate to their official actions as president. civil lawsuitscivil(For example, the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal emerged from an investigation into Bill Clinton’s personal life, stemming from a civil lawsuit brought against him by Paula Jones while Clinton was president.) Trump’s attorneys are asking the District Court to declare the subpoena invalid and issue an injunction preventing the D.A.’s office from enforcing it and Mazars from complying with it. To that extent, Trump is also suing the accountancy firm.As of Sept. 23, Trump’s legal team had filed a complaint, an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, a proposed order granting that motion, and a memorandum of law in support of that motion. Across those dozens of pages of legal argument, none of Trump’s lawyers has once averred or admitted that their client has engaged in any criminal actions. motionRather, they have argued that the U.S. Constitution forbids the D.A. from conducting a criminal investigation into Trump until he is no longer president, and that therefore the District Court must temporarily block the D.A.’s efforts to obtain Trump’s personal federal tax returns by issuing a subpoena to his accountants. As such, the headline of Vanity Fair’s article (as opposed to the article itself) was grossly misleading. Although it did not explicitly attribute a statement to Trump, the wording of the headline created that widespread false impression. Trump did not say, “My crimes can’t be investigated while I’m president,” nor did he make any similar statement in which he admitted having acted criminally, nor did his lawyers make an argument that involved an admission of criminal wrongdoing on the president’s part.Subsequent social media posts that attributed “My crimes can’t be investigated while I’m president” to Trump, as a direct quotation, were downright false.",[],"[{""id"" : 4848272"",""""begin"": 109,""end"": 121,""entity"": ""Donald Trump"",""text"": ""Donald Trump"",""score"": 0.59,""categories"" : [""Living

The article received a fair amount of social media attention in the days immediately following its publication, partly because college-football fans enjoyed making jokes about Gundy’s mullet, but also because some readers mistook this piece of fiction as a genuine news article. In fact, a news reporter who was seemingly fooled by this article asked Gundy about Pickens’ fictional will during a press conference:During Monday morning’s teleconference with Big 12 coaches, Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy was seemingly offended by an odd question.Asked by an Austin reporter about a recent social-media joke about the late Boone Pickens leaving a gift card for Gundy to get his famous mullet cut, Gundy appeared to ignore the question the first time it was asked.After an uncomfortable pause, Gundy said: “I would prefer to answer real journalism questions and not be disrespectful to Mr. Pickens at this time. Any jackass like you that would ask a stupid question like that is really hurting journalism and making real media people look bad.During Monday morning’s teleconference with Big 12 coaches, Oklahoma State coach Mike Gundy was seemingly offended by an odd question.Asked by an Austin reporter about a recent social-media joke about the late Boone Pickens leaving a gift card for Gundy to get his famous mullet cut, Gundy appeared to ignore the question the first time it was asked.After an uncomfortable pause, Gundy said: “I would prefer to answer real journalism questions and not be disrespectful to Mr. Pickens at this time.

He’s just sleeping.The photograph was first posted online in 2016. It was originally shared in the “TIFU” (today I f*cked up) section of Reddit under the caption: “TIFU by falling asleep at the job on my second day.” This picture was then subsequently posted to “PSBattles,” a section of Reddit dedicated to photoshopping images, and quickly became a viral meme:TIFUPSBattles Shortly after the picture went viral, this sleepy individual (a Redditor by the name of TheOrangeDuke) spoke with the Huffington Post about his internet infamy:Huffington Post“One of the associates noticed me sleeping,” he told The Huffington Post. “And it just went downhill from there!”The lighthearted staff decided to snap an office photo with the slumbering intern. When he awoke, he found the picture so funny that he posted it on Reddit …And believe it or not, TheOrangeDuke, who would like for him and his company to remain anonymous, did not get fired for catching zzz’s at work. He’s on his third day of his internship and had a perfectly logical reason for his catnap.“I have been diagnosed with anemia, as shown by my amazing skin color, that causes me to be ultra sleepy!” he said.“One of the associates noticed me sleeping,” he told The Huffington Post. “And it just went downhill from there!”The lighthearted staff decided to snap an office photo with the slumbering intern.

62,,snopes,,A photograph shows a pile of rubbish left in Hyde Park by global-warming protesters.,2019-04-23,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/protesters-hyde-park-rubbish/,,,,"In late April 2019, social media users started sharing images that supposedly showed piles of rubbish in London’s Hyde Park. Many of these posts claimed that the refuse had been left behind after a global-warming-protest event held by the group “Extinction Rebellion” (XR):sharingimagesWhile one of these images truly shows rubbish in Hyde Park (the other was taken in Mumbai), neither of these photographs show the aftermath of the global-warming protest. The image on the right is at least a year old and comes from Versova beach in Mumbai, India. It appears that this image was circulated in a bad-faith attempt to paint global-warming protesters in a negative light.year oldThe image on the left truly shows rubbish in Hyde Park. However, the image was taken in the aftermath of a celebration for 420, a marijuana-centric holiday, not a global-warming protest. !function(r,u,m,b,l,e){r._Rumble=b,r[b]||(r[b]=function(){(r[b]._=r[b]._||[]).push(arguments);if(r[b]._.length==1){l=u.createElement(m),e=u.getElementsByTagName(m)[0],l.async=1,l.src='https://rumble.com/embedJS/ucxbq'+(arguments[1].video?'.'+arguments[1].video:'')+'/?url='+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+'&args='+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify([].slice.apply(arguments))),e.parentNode.insertBefore(l,e)}})}(window, document, 'script', 'Rumble');!function(r,u,m,b,l,e){r._Rumble=b,r[b]||(r[b]=function(){(r[b]._=r[b]._||[]).push(arguments);if(r[b]._.length==1){l=u.createElement(m),e=u.getElementsByTagName(m)[0],l.async=1,l.src='https://rumble.com/embedJS/ucxbq'+(arguments[1].video?'.'+arguments[1].video:'')+'/?url='+encodeURIComponent(location.href)+'&args='+encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify([].slice.apply(arguments))),e.parentNode.insertBefore(l,e)}})}(window, document, 'script', 'Rumble');       Rumble('play', {'video': 'v4wqmh','div': 'rumble_v4wqmh','autoplay':2});       Rumble('play', {'video': 'v4wqmh','div': 'rumble_v4wqmh','autoplay':2});As the reefer revelers gathered in Hyde Park on 20 April 2019, the Extinction Rebellion was at the nearby Marble Arch for a global-warming rally.  It appears the rubbish left behind by one group was later blamed on the other. Marble ArchThe confusion likely stemmed in part from a post by the Facebook page THTC (The Hemp Trading Company), which mentioned the proximity of the Extinction Rebellion to the 420 rally when THTC first shared this image:FacebookThis is #HydePark after #420. Ashamed is not the word. With #extinctionrebellion not yards away, so many of you couldn’t be bothered to clean up after yourselves. Ironic for a movement that holds a plant in such high regard. #cannabiscommunity you can do better – you need to do better.This is #HydePark after #420. Ashamed is not the word. With #extinctionrebellion not yards away, so many of you couldn’t be bothered to clean up after yourselves. Ironic for a movement that holds a plant in such high regard. #cannabiscommunity you can do better – you need to do better.This Facebook page later updated the post to clarify who was responsible for the rubbish. THTC explained this image showed garbage left behind by 420 revelers, and that Extinction Rebellion’s only connection to the mess came from members who helped clean up the mess:IMPORTANT EDIT: a lot of people are misreading this post. This was the aftermath of Hyde Park 420 – and was *cleaned up* by Extinction Rebellion crew. THTC is nothing but supportive of XR. Please read *all* the post copy before flying off the handle, people… EDIT: Posted this in the comments, but all this ended up being cleaned up by a crew from Extinction Rebellion, which included the absolute eco-warrior legend, Swampy!IMPORTANT EDIT: a lot of people are misreading this post.

While Clinton would eventually be impeached on charges such as “making false and misleading statements to potential grand jury witnesses,” this fake tweet is commenting on a bluntly (and incorrectly) boiled-down version of Clinton’s impeachment.impeachmentThis tweet does not appear on Lewinsky’s official Twitter timeline. We also searched a cached version of her page to see if the tweet had recently been deleted, but came up empty there, as well. timelineWhile we found a number of people sharing this message, they all did so by posting a text version of this message or by posting the above-displayed screenshot. We were unable to find any instances of a person retweeting the actual tweet link, nor any links to a genuine message that was recently deleted. actualThis tweet is also suspicious because the image indicates it was sent with “Twitter for Android.” Lewinksy’s tweets, however, are most often sent via iPhone. iPhoneThis fake tweet appears to have been created by the @electorotting (notice watermark in upper right-hand corner of image), an Instagram page that frequently posts political memes and jokes. While the account occasionally shares genuine posts from political leaders (Sen. Lindsey Graham truly once posted on Twitter “If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed … and we will deserve it”), the fake tweets shared by @electorotting all appear to be marked with the social media page’s watermark.  InstagramsharesSen.

64,,snopes,,NASA and NOAA faked climate data in the GISTEMP global temperature record to exaggerate global warming.,2019-10-03,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/global-warming-data-faked/,,,,"Since 2014, climate-change deniers have squeezed millions of views, Facebook shares, and Twitter retweets by retelling a story alleging the discovery of “faked” NASA data designed to “fit a climate change narrative.” Though copied almost wholesale from a blog post, the version of the story that has had the most online traction was published on the one-stop conspiracy theory/supplement shop that goes by the name Natural News. The article suggested:squeezedblog postsuggestedIn what might be the largest scientific fraud ever uncovered, NASA and the NOAA have been caught red-handed altering historical temperature data to produce a “climate change narrative” that defies reality. […] We now know that historical temperature data for the continental United States were deliberately altered by NASA and NOAA scientists in a politically-motivated attempt to rewrite history and claim global warming is causing U.S. temperatures to trend upward.In what might be the largest scientific fraud ever uncovered, NASA and the NOAA have been caught red-handed altering historical temperature data to produce a “climate change narrative” that defies reality. […] We now know that historical temperature data for the continental United States were deliberately altered by NASA and NOAA scientists in a politically-motivated attempt to rewrite history and claim global warming is causing U.S. temperatures to trend upward.There is a lot to unpack here, but the first thing you need to know is records of global surface temperatures are constantly refined based on the addition of new data, fresh statistical analyses, or new historical insight into the history of a specific source of data. Reporting on such a shift as something to “uncover” betrays a potentially willful ignorance of how climate science operates. These changes are publicly reported, based on stated scientific criteria, and subjected to rigorous internal and external peer review.constantly refinedWhere is this coming from?The “smoking gun” concerns a climate record known as the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP). These records are based on a massive global dataset of temperature stations from around the world, combining several collections of data originally collected by individual weather stations. The record provides “a measure of the changing global surface temperature with monthly resolution for the period since 1880, when a reasonably global distribution of meteorological stations was established.”GISTEMPprovidesTo argue for evidence of “faked” data, Natural News, as well as the original blog post, highlighted a version of the GISTEMP record for the United States first published in 1999, comparing it to one published later, in 2012. The record, these sources point out, has shifted:(These charts plot how far off each year’s average U.S. temperature differs from the average temperature for the entire period 1951–1980; the frame labeled “a” is from 1999.)chartsIt should be no shock that the data shifted following 1999, as illustrated graphically in the above diagram, because NASA published multiple papers in 1999 and 2001 about these changes and why they were made. Links to these papers can be found on the NASA website, which also publicly summarizes the changes in several other places.multiplepapers summarizesWhy adjust climate data?Writing for the climate information website Skeptical Science, Berkeley Earth research scientist Zeke Hausfather, whose work (in part) independently analyzes adjustments made by government agencies’ climate records, explained the need for making adjustments to such datasets in general. A primary misconception, he argues, is that an “unadjusted global temperature record” — which necessarily has to take into account not only the temperature reading at a given recording station, but also how to translate that data spatially to come up with a single annual or monthly number — is not really a thing that exists to begin with:Zeke HausfatherexplainedThere are a number of folks who question the need for adjustments at all. Why not just use raw temperatures, they ask, since those are pure and unadulterated? The problem is that … there is really no such thing as a pure and unadulterated temperature record. Temperature stations in the U.S. are mainly operated by volunteer observers (the Cooperative Observer Network, or co-op stations for short). Many of these stations were set up in the late 1800s and early 1900s as part of a national network of weather stations, focused on measuring day-to-day changes in the weather rather than decadal-scale changes in the climate.Nearly every single station in the network in the network has been moved at least once over the last century, with many having 3 or more distinct moves. Most of the stations have changed [the type of instruments used]. Observation times have shifted from afternoon to morning at most stations since 1960, as part of an effort by the National Weather Service to improve precipitation measurements.There are a number of folks who question the need for adjustments at all.

Observation times have shifted from afternoon to morning at most stations since 1960, as part of an effort by the National Weather Service to improve precipitation measurements.So what were the issues that led to changes between the 1999 record and the later record? According to NASA’s GISTEMP website, “Starting in the 1990s, the methodology took into account documented non-climatic biases in the raw data and eliminated or corrected unrealistic outliers.” The goal of these adjustments is to remove shoddy data from the dataset using pre-established methodologies, not to fit a “climate change narrative.”AccordingThese “non-climatic biases” include things like stations taking temperature measurements at different times of day, stations physically moving locations (sometimes to a different elevation), and other artifacts that produce change in a record not attributable to climate or weather. These non-climatic biases were identified and their method of adjustment described in a publicly available 2001 paper found, among other places, on NASA’s website. They included:includedTime of observation: Not all stations collect observations at the same time, and some stations — most significantly in the United States — have changed the time at which data is collected over time. Correcting for these effects is the most significant adjustment made to the GISTEMP dataset post-1999.Station location history: Sometimes stations move to another location, affecting the record. Post-1999 records take this into account.Change in thermometer type: A well-defined shift in data came from a change from liquid-in-glass thermometers to the maximum-minimum temperature system (MMTS). Post-1999 records take this into account.Urban heat effect: Densely populated urban areas retain heat more than rural areas. An increase in stations in urban areas over time, for example, would create a false warming trend. Post 1999 records take this into account as well.Time of observation: Not all stations collect observations at the same time, and some stations — most significantly in the United States — have changed the time at which data is collected over time.

The methods used and their effect on the data are all disclosed online. However the issues described above are largely moot at the time of this writing in 2019. The GISTEMP analyses at issue above concern a formulation of the dataset (GISTEMP v3) that has been replaced by an improved model named GISTEMP v4, which includes a much larger set of data and a whole other set of adjustments.employ modelsGISTEMP v4“Caught red-handed”All told, the most significant effect of all these changes came from the time-of-day adjustments. Collectively, the adjustments served to produce a slightly increased warming trend in the United States record compared to the earlier records.warming trendThe largest adjustments are the time of observation debiasing and station history adjustment, each of which increases the mean warming over the United States by about 0.15ºC over the 100 years. The net of all five adjustments to the … record is a warming of about 0.3ºCThe largest adjustments are the time of observation debiasing and station history adjustment, each of which increases the mean warming over the United States by about 0.15ºC over the 100 years. The net of all five adjustments to the … record is a warming of about 0.3ºCTo suggest — 14 years after the fact — that identifying publicly discussed adjustments to raw data whose methods have been published in peer-reviewed journals represents catching scientists “red-handed” in “the largest scientific fraud ever uncovered” exposes only the ignorance of the author, not some nefarious sleight of hand by climate scientists. As such, the claim is rated “False.”",[],"[{""id"" : 7529378"",""""begin"": 65,""end"": 73,""entity"": ""Facebook"",""text"": ""Facebook"",""score"": 0.37,""categories"" : [""Facebook"",""Android

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez suggested eating babies to combat climate change at a town hall event.,2019-10-04,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/babies-climate-change-aoc/,,,,"An Oct. 3, 2019, town hall event in New York City hosted by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., was going smoothly until a woman in a black jacket stood up and started rambling her fears about apocalyptic climate change. Then she took her jacket off, revealing a T-shirt that read, “Save the planet. Eat the children.”T-shirtThe woman said she was glad Ocasio-Cortez supported the Green New Deal but stated it was not enough. “Your new campaign slogan has to be this,” she stated, taking her jacket off and revealing the shirt. “We got to start eating babies. We don’t have enough time. … Even if you would bomb Russia, we still have too many people, too much pollution!”Words and images from the event shared online prompted reactions from many, including U.S. President Donald Trump and his eldest son, Donald Jr.includingSeems like a normal AOC supporter to me. https://t.co/NWVMRD0wsl— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 4, 2019Seems like a normal AOC supporter to me. https://t.co/NWVMRD0wslhttps://t.co/NWVMRD0wsl— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 4, 2019October 4, 2019During the town hall, Ocasio-Cortez responded to the woman by talking about the need for positive solutions to climate change and concluding, “We are never beyond hope” before quickly moving on to another question.Although some on the political right criticized her response, Ocasio-Cortez followed up on Twitter by explaining that she had been operating under the assumption that the woman was mentally ill and in crisis.somerightThis person may have been suffering from a mental condition and it’s not okay that the right-wing is mocking her and potentially make her condition or crisis worse. Be a decent human being and knock it off.— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 4, 2019This person may have been suffering from a mental condition and it’s not okay that the right-wing is mocking her and potentially make her condition or crisis worse. Be a decent human being and knock it off.— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 4, 2019October 4, 2019It turned out the woman in question was neither an Ocasio-Cortez supporter nor a person having a mental-health emergency but apparently acting at the behest of a group called Lyndon LaRouche PAC. The stunt was meant to troll Ocasio-Cortez.groupHistorian Matthew Sweet described the group as a “bizarre political cult” in an interview with The Washington Post about the incident. Sweet, who has studied the group’s history, told the Post that the woman’s stunt fell in line with their standard operating procedures. “The tactic,” Sweet told the Post, “is you go to a political meeting and you create a disturbance that disrupts the meeting, and more importantly, that creates a kind of chaos.”describedThe group, dubbed LaRouchians, has been around for decades, and was founded by conspiracy crank Lyndon LaRouche, who died in February 2019 at the age of 96 after building a “worldwide following based on conspiracy theories, economic doom, anti-Semitism, homophobia and racism.”buildingLaRouche’s conspiracy theories involve proffering claims that the Queen of England controls the international drug trade and that Adolf Hitler, whose forces bombed England in World War II, was a British agent.controlsagent",[],"[{""id"" : 645042"",""""begin"": 33,""end"": 46,""entity"": ""New York City"",""text"": ""New York City"",""score"": 0.40,""categories"" : [""New York

66,,snopes,,Videos have captured strange apocalyptic sounds coming from the sky all around the world.,2015-04-30,snopes,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-sound-of-apocalypse/,,,,"On 10 April 2015, the web site Latin Post shared a video purportedly featuring “strange apocalyptic sounds coming from the sky all around the world.” That video comprises clips from various videos uploaded to YouTube between 2011 and 2013; and while it’s impossible for us to offer a comprehensive explanation covering every clip seen in that video, we can provide a skeptical look about the alleged “apocalyptic noises” it references.Latin PostLatin PostThis video claims that there has been creepy strange noises around the world, many of the comments under these videos are very “world coming to an end” type comments. People are claiming they are trumpets playing. There is no scientific explanation for these noises. I just want to know it it’s nonsense or not.This video claims that there has been creepy strange noises around the world, many of the comments under these videos are very “world coming to an end” type comments. People are claiming they are trumpets playing. There is no scientific explanation for these noises. I just want to know it it’s nonsense or not.Unusual and unexplained noises are recorded in various locations around the world from time to time. While the specific origins of all such sounds may not yet be known, most scientific research points to natural causes such as tidal waves, methane explosions, underground earthquakes, or shifting sand dunes as explanations for these aural phenomena:researchThere are many potential explanations, according to David Hill, a scientist at the US Geological Survey, who wrote a recent scientific review paper rounding up the causes of mystery booms. In coastal regions, for instance, large bangs may accompany humungous waves hitting the cliffs; reports of thunderous sounds are apparently common among big-wave surfers in the US.Hill suspects that earthquakes are to blame in the majority of cases. He’s talking from experience; while in California’s Mammoth Mountain he was surrounded by a muffled booming sound, despite feeling no shaking. On inspecting his instruments he found evidence of small earthquakes less than 4 km (2.9 miles) below the surface. Whereas sounds of deeper earthquakes may be too low for human hearing, he has calculated that judders near the surface could transmit audible noises of the cracking crust.There are many potential explanations, according to David Hill, a scientist at the US Geological Survey, who wrote a recent scientific review paper rounding up the causes of mystery booms.

Whereas sounds of deeper earthquakes may be too low for human hearing, he has calculated that judders near the surface could transmit audible noises of the cracking crust.Although it is likely that “strange apocalyptic” booming sounds seemingly issuing from the sky have an earthly origin, USGS scientist David Hill said that it’s also possible some of these noises originate from above:You might think it unlikely that we would miss the flash of a meteor, but it’s not impossible, as Hill notes: ‘Because of the time required for a sonic shock wave to reach the Earth’s surface from the upper atmosphere, the visible trace of the meteor has usually vanished before its sonic boom is heard.’You might think it unlikely that we would miss the flash of a meteor, but it’s not impossible, as Hill notes: ‘Because of the time required for a sonic shock wave to reach the Earth’s surface from the upper atmosphere, the visible trace of the meteor has usually vanished before its sonic boom is heard.’Is that what we’re hearing in the video above — a distant earthquake or a passing meteor? Although some of the sounds captured in the video may have natural explanations, some of the other noises clearly originated from a common, artificial source: an iPhone.At the 4:45 mark in the above-displayed video, a clip purportedly taken in Alberta, Canada, begins to play and (like all of the other clips in this video) features a strange and seemingly unexplainable noise. But this section of the video is unique in having a definitive explanation: YouTube user DangleSnipeCelly08 admitted that the clip she uploaded on 14 January 2012 was a hoax:admittedI made the video by taking out my iPhone and merely video recorded my balcony view while holding my laptop right behind it, while my laptop played (another video featuring strange sounds) in the background. Took less than a minute to do this.I made it because I was surprised at the attention (these videos were) getting, and the friends on my Facebook friends list were voicing their fear, which I think is wrong. I easily found that the Conklin video and I believe the Ukraine video has the exact same audio on them (hello Tropical birds in Conklin), so I decided that I had to share my knowledge. I made the video to show my friends and family how easy it was (literally less than five minutes of my life to make the video and upload it) to make something like that, and how they shouldn’t believe everything they see online, and should especially not get fearful.I made the video by taking out my iPhone and merely video recorded my balcony view while holding my laptop right behind it, while my laptop played (another video featuring strange sounds) in the background.

Although it’s possible that a recurring natural phenomenon has been captured in various locations around the world, it is more plausible that a single audio stream was duplicated and embedded into multiple video clips.Latin PostStill, the original noise had to come from somewhere. So is this noise natural, or supernatural? The most likely answer is that the sound came from Hollywood:Even if the majority of clips in the video shared by Latin Post do not feature “apocalyptic noises” coming from the sky, the world is not void of unexplainable noises.
